Three drones targeted a U.S. base in Syria's Al-Tanf region on Friday but no American troops were injured, the U.S. military said in a statement. U.S. Central Command said two of the drones were shot down while the remaining drone hit the compound, injuring two members of the Syrian Free Army forces.
