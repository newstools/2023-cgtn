Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is not only known for its delicacies, natural scenery and mixed culture, but also for growing chilies. A local chili processing company integrates Xinjiang chili cultivation, research, processing and sale. It incorporates more native quality farm products into the chili sauce. The growing business has greatly increased local villagers' incomes and helped facilitate rural revitalization.
