Mohamed Jihad is a lecturer from Egypt who now lives and works in Hebei Province. Since he first came to China in 2017, he has lived in Tianjin, Beijing and Hebei, among other places. Over the past three years, he has witnessed China's resilience during the pandemic and its determination to "put the people in the first place." After China adjusted the COVID-19 policies, he hit the streets of Hebei to show how life has changed in local communities. He praised China for its epidemic prevention work, sending vaccines and other supplies to other countries, including Egypt, and condemned foreign media for bias against China's COVID prevention work.
