A Chinese icebreaker owned and upgraded by the Sun Yat-Sen University completed a trial voyage in the Bohai Sea on Wednesday, becoming the third polar icebreaker in China after Xuelong-2 and Xuelong. The icebreaker, dubbed "Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di," which literally translated means the polar icebreaker of Sun Yat-Sen University, arrived at the ice sea area of Liaodong Bay in the Bohai Sea to carry out icebreaking tests on January 25. The sea ice area at the time had exceeded 10,000 square kilometers and the outer edge line had reached 56 nautical miles, which provided ideal conditions for icebreaking tests, including low temperature navigation, ice breaking, ice area scientific research support and other capabilities. It also tested out shipborne scientific research equipment and safety design of the ship. The vessel was donated by Chinese private entrepreneurs Zhang Xinyu and Liang Hong, who are also famous for their self-initiated world adventures. It had previously served in the Arctic region for over 10 years for rescue, supply and offshore oil exploration purposes. At 78.95 meters long and 17.22 meters wide, and with displacement of 5,852 tonnes and draft of 8.16 meters, the ship was assigned as Polar Classes 3, according to the International Association of Classification Societies, with 1 being the highest, capable of operation in all polar waters year-round. After its donation to the university in 2022, its equipment was upgraded in a joint effort with shipyard companies. The university said that the program would encourage scientific and technological innovation and talent training for polar exploration.
