TheÂ U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) conducted a search at President Joe Biden's home in Wilmington on Friday and found additional classified documents, Biden's lawyer said on Saturday night. "DOJ took possession of materials it deemed within the scope of its inquiry, including six items consisting of documents with classification markings and surrounding materials, some of which were from the President's service in the Senate and some of which were from his tenure as Vice President," according to a statement from Biden's personal attorney Bob Bauer. The president offered access "to his home to allow DOJ to conduct a search of the entire premises for potential vice-presidential records and potential classified material," Bauer said. Neither Biden nor his wife were present during the search.
