China aims to double its manufacturing robot density by 2025 compared with the level in 2020, according to a plan released on Thursday. Robot density, measured by the number of robots per 10,000 workers in an industry, is a key indicator for measuring intelligent manufacturing levels. The "robotics+" action plan, jointly issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and 16 other government departments, set the target of significantly increasing the use of service and special robots, and strengthening robots' role in promoting high-quality economic and social development. The plan called for a focus on the application of robots in 10 key sectors: manufacturing, agriculture, construction, energy, logistics, medical care, elderly care, education, commercial services, and emergency response and applications in extreme environments. A batch of industry-leading enterprises of "robotics+" applications will be cultivated, while experience centers and verification centers of robots will be established. The plan also emphasized efforts to build a collaborative innovation system for robot production and application. (With input from Xinhua)
