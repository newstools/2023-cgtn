China's adjustment of COVID-19 response and entry-exit policies are timely and necessary based on new characteristics of the variants and the country's reality, Anton Bugayenko, chief expert of the Chinese and Asian Studies Program under the Institute of World Economy and Politics in Kazakhstan, said in a recent interview with CGTN. Bugayenko said that some countries are imposing restrictions on Chinese arrivals only for "political purposes." "China has adjusted its epidemic prevention and control measures more than once based on its own actual situation... Currently, the virus has weakened. So, China has taken steps to open its borders and lift restrictions." "Some countries still insist on testing people who come from China, entering the country, for COVID. It is not reasonable. There are political reasons for that. At least in terms of public opinion propaganda about the 'China threat,' this measure in Western countries is very useful." The expert noted that this kind of advocacy is the greatest danger, as the "original non-political issue of health has been politicized."
