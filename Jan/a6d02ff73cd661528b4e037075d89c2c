Sean McVay, head coach of the Los Angeles Rams, will stay in the position, the team announced on Friday. As the reigning Super Bowl champions, the Rams finished the 2022 NFL regular season with a disappointing 5-12 record and missed the playoffs. The team was unlucky enough to lose quarterback Matthew Stafford, wide receiver Cooper Kupp and defensive tackle Aaron Donald to injuries, all of which cost the franchise heavily. When McVay said he will take the "appropriate time" to make a decision on his future at the press conference on Monday, it raised concerns about if he will leave the Rams like it did the same when he said he "won't make it" if he is coaching until he is 60 after they won Super Bowl LVI in February 2022. He came back to the team after the Super Bowl victory and he did so after the first losing season (with a winning percentage of below .500) since he took over the Rams in 2017. The team won three National Football Conference (NFC) West titles, two NFC Championships and one Vince Lombardi Trophy under him. "The ultimate thing is you want to make ... sure that this joy, this zest, this ability to be able to do the things at the level that you know you're capable of, how do you not let the challenges and the grind and the competitor in you ... how do you not let that change the dynamic of who you want to be as a leader in those types of things? And that's kind of where I'm at," McVay said. A head coach can't do everything for the team. If the Rams want to make a difference in the next season, they first will need their players, especially the core ones, to stay healthy. Part of Stafford's poor performance this season came from the right elbow he was battling when he was playing. Kupp will undergo a surgery to fix a high ankle sprain. Donald suffered the same injury as well.
