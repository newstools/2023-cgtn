Our staff put on a panda suit and prepared to serve food to the panda. Why? This is because feeders take care to avoid giant panda cubs becoming dependent on humans when they are released into the wild. The film crew is working on a project called "Nature of China," which is an international documentary project co-produced by CMG and Arte. Do you want to know more about the documentary? Have a glimpse behind the scenes. (Cover image is a screenshot.) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
