China on Friday launched a Long March-2D carrier rocket, placing three satellites in space. The rocket blasted off at 3 p.m. Beijing Time from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China and sent the satellites Yaogan-37, Shiyan-22A, and Shiyan-22B into a preset orbit. The three satellites will mainly be used for the in-orbit verification of new technologies such as space environment monitoring. It was the 461st flight mission in the Long March series rockets.
