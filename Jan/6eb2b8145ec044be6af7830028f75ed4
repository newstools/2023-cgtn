Finland's defense ministry said Wednesday the country had issued the first commercial export license for military material to TÃ¼rkiye since 2019 -- a key demand for Ankara to approve Helsinki's NATO bid. Riikka Pitkanen, special adviser at the ministry, told AFP that the export license granted concerned steel that would be used for armour.
