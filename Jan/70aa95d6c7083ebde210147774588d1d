A white-throated kingfisher has joined the bird family around the small lake on the campus of Hainan University in southern China's Hainan Province. The bird, also known as the white-breasted kingfisher, is a tree kingfisher. The eye-catching color combination of the feathers, particularly the electric blue on its back, makes it a favorite among many bird-lovers.
