Drones attacked a convoy of trucks in eastern Syria shortly after it crossed into the country from Iraq, Syrian opposition activists and a pro-government radio station said. There was no immediate word on casualties. The strike on Sunday came amid heightening tension between Iran and its rivals in the region. It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack in the Syrian border region of Boukamal, a stronghold of Iran-backed militias.
