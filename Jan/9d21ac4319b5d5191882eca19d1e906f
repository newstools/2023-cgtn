Two Indian Air Force fighter jets crashed Saturday, killing one pilot, in an apparent mid-air collision while on exercises south of the capital New Delhi. The crash involved a Russian-made Sukhoi Su-30, carrying two pilots, and a French-built Mirage 2000, operated by a third. Both aircraft had taken off in the morning from the Gwalior air base, around 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of where they came down. "The aircraft were on routine operational flying training mission," the country's air force said in a statement, adding that one of the three pilots had sustained fatal injuries. An investigation was underway to determine the cause of the crash, it added.
