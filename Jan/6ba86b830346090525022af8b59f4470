A nurses strike at two major New York City hospitals carried on for a third day on January 11 as the labor union tried to work out a deal to increase wages and staffing levels. Nurses standing outside Montefiore Medical Center's Moses campus said more nurses need to be hired to reduce the strain on the current staff and improve patient care. The union stressed staffing levels as a key concern, saying that nurses who labored through the grueling peak of the coronavirus pandemic are stretched far too thin because too many jobs are open.
