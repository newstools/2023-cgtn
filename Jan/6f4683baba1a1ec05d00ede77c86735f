More than 7,000 nurses working at two major New York City hospitals went on strike on Monday after failing over the weekend to reach an agreement to renegotiate their contracts. In order to cope with the walkout, the privately-owned hospitals are postponing selective surgeries, diverting ambulances to other facilities, pulling in temporary staffers, and assigning administrators with nursing backgrounds to work in wards.
