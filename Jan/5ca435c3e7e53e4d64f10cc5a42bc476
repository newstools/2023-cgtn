U.S. President Joe Biden said on January 10 that he was surprised to learn that classified documents were found in a think-tank office he once used, adding that he and his team are cooperating fully with a review into what had happened. Ten classified documents, dating back to the period when Biden was serving as vice president, were discovered in his private office last fall, including materials relating to Ukraine, Iran and the U.K., including U.S. intelligence memos and briefing materials.
