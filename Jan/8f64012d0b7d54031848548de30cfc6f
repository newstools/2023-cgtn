At least eight people were killed on Friday in an attack launched by Houthi fighters on Yemeni government military sites in the southern province of Lahj, a local military official told Xinhua. "A group of Houthi fighters carried out an attack and attempted to advance militarily on the ground in order to capture key sites controlled by the government forces in the northern part of Lahj Province," the official said on condition of anonymity. The attack sparked intense fighting that left at least five rebels and three government soldiers dead, he said, adding that the rebel fighters were forced to retreat hours later.
