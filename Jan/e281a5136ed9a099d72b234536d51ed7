A state of emergency has been declared in Auckland over severe flooding on Friday, local media RNZ reported. Auckland Airport has closed its international terminal check-in due to flooding inside the building, said the report. So far, one person has been reported killed by the floodwater. Videos on social media showed firefighters, police and defense force staff rescuing stranded people from flooded homes using ropes and rescue boats. No details were immediately available on how many people had been evacuated so far. Major roads were also blocked by the floods, causing long traffic queues on highways. Police said they were working with Fire and Emergency New Zealand to respond to calls and asked people to stay off the roads if possible. Auckland Emergency Management said in a post on Twitter that northern, northwestern and western parts of the city were affected by significant flooding, with conditions expected to worsen. The agency advised residents in flood-prone areas to prepare to evacuate and opened an evacuation centre in West Auckland. (With input from agencies)
