Sixty-six koalas from one family across seven generations made a public appearance to greet their fans before the Spring Festival in south China's Guangdong Province. The big family lives at the Chimelong Safari Park in Guangzhou City. It recently welcomed six newborn babies, who were carried on the backs of the mothers. "At first we brought in six koalas. It's relatively hard to feed koalas because they only eat eucalyptus leaves and don't need to drink water. Sometimes they sleep for 18 to 20 hours a day. We need to observe them carefully and with great attention," said Chen Shuqing, a koala breeder. The oldest in the family is the 17-year-old koala Uki, who likes to stay motionless on the tree. Considering the average age for a koala is 10-12 years old, Uki is over 100 years old in human age. The group expanded to 60 koalas in 2019, becoming the world's largest koala group outside Australia.
