Azaleas are one of the best-selling Chinese New Year flowers as their red color symbolizes good fortune and auspiciousness. However, red is not their only color. They can be pink, yellow, orange or even white. They usually bloom in the spring and the blooming period lasts for several weeks. Renowned for their beauty, azaleas are also highly toxic. They contain andromedotoxins in both their leaves and nectar. If you have cats at home, remember to put the flowers away from them.
