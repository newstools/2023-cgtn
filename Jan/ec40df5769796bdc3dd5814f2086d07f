Sweden is confident that T端rkiye will approve its application to join the NATO military alliance, but cannot fulfill all the demands Ankara has made as the price of its support, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Sunday at a defense think-tank conference in Sweden. "T端rkiye both confirms that we have done what we said we would do, but they also say that they want things that we cannot or do not want to give them," Kristersson said. Sweden, Finland and T端rkiye signed a three-way agreement in 2022 aimed at overcoming T端rkiye's objections to NATO membership for the two countries.
