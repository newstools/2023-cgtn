China will prioritize employment in 2023, utilizing fiscal and monetary measures, Wang Xiaoping, Minister of Human Resources and Social Security, said in a recent interview with Xinhua. More support will be given to the service sector, micro and small enterprises, and self-employed individuals to boost employment opportunities, she noted. The country created 12 million jobs in urban regions last year, surpassing its annual target, and the overall employment situation is expected to remain stable in 2023 as the economy continues to recover, Wang said. China's domestic consumption is likely to rebound sharply as COVID-19 prevention measures are eased, Wang Tao, head of Asia economics and chief China economist at UBS Investment Bank, said in an interview with CGTN. The economic rebound will boost small- and medium-sized enterprises as well as employment and income levels, Wang Tao added. Wang Xiaoping acknowledged existing pressure and challenges in ensuring employment, pledging to "go all out to maintain overall stability in employment." The minister highlighted work to help fresh college graduates find jobs as "a top priority," as 11.58 million students are expected to graduate this year. Among a host of measures to address the challenges, the country will provide subsidies to encourage companies to create jobs, according to Wang. She said that efforts will also be made to stabilize recruitment in the public sector, enhance services and training, and offer personalized assistance for graduates who have difficulty finding jobs.
