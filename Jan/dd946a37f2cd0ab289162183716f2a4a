Third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas powered into the semifinals, while two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka wound back the clock to stun Jessica Pegula at the Australian Open on Tuesday. The 24-year-old Greek proved too powerful for the unseeded Czech Jiri Lehecka, as he stormed 6-3, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 on his maiden Grand Slam title journey. He will face the Russian 18th seed Karen Khachanov for a place in his first Melbourne Park final, having crashed out in the semis three times previously, including in the past two years. Khachanov booked his place when American Sebastian Korda retired hurt with a wrist injury while trailing 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 3-0. The Russian is into his second straight Grand Slam semi-final after last September's U.S. Open. Tsitsipas will become world No. 1 for the first time should he win the title at the Australian Open. Meanwhile, Belarusian Azarenka made a dominant victory over third-seed American Pegula 6-4, 6-1. The 2012 and 2013 champion faces Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the last four – a battle between the last two Grand Slam champions left in the draw. "She's powerful. Big serve. She's in the semi-final, so she's playing amazingly. She had tough wins,” the 33-year-old veteran said. Rybakina sealed a 6-2, 6-4 triumph over Jelena Ostapenko with her 11th ace, her 190kmh serve proving her most potent weapon. Rybakina has delivered 35 aces in reaching the semi-finals, more than any other woman at Melbourne Park. (With input from agencies)
