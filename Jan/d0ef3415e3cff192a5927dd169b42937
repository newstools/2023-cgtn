Two people were wounded in a shooting attack in Jerusalem on Saturday, emergency services say, the day after a gunman killed at least seven people near a synagogue in the city. A father, 47, and his 23-year-old son sustained gunshot wounds to their upper bodies and were rushed to hospital, police and medics said. The shooter was reportedly a 13-year-old resident of eastern Jerusalem. The weapon he carried was seized by police shortly after he was neutralized, said local media.
