The Chinese mainland has administered nearly 3.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs three doses, that's enough to have vaccinated about 82 percent of the country's population. Over 90 percent of the 1.4 billion population was fully vaccinated, and over 92 percent of the population received at least one dose. With a population of 267 million aged above 60, China is ramping up vaccination among this group. In late November, the country released a work plan to improve the vaccination rate among the elderly. The plan calls for continuing to increase the vaccination rate of people aged 60-79, and in particular, accelerating the increase in the vaccination rate of people over 80, those most vulnerable to the virus. Among those aged 60 and older, about 70 percent received two jabs and a booster shot in December. That's a big improvement from March, when 52 percent of those over 60 had received a booster shot. Around 77 percent of the elderly aged 80 and older have received at least one dose, approximately 66 percent are fully vaccinated, and about 40 percent have received a booster shot. China has also started administering a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose, including an innovative inhalable version. (Data edited by Zhao Hong; graphic designed by Mukesh Mohanan)
