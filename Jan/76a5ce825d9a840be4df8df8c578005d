The ministry said that six Chinese shipbuilders were ranked among the world's top 10 in terms of these three major indicators â€“ output, new and holding orders. In addition, according to data from the China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry, Chinese shipping companies undertook 55 orders for large LNG carriers in 2022, a record high at over 30 percent of the global total.
