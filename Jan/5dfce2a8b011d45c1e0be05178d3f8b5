China's research and development (R&D) expenditure reached 3,087 billion yuan ($455 billion) in 2022, a new record high and a 10.4-percent rise over the previous year, preliminary data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed Friday. As of 2022, the country's R&D spending has maintained its double-digit growth for seven consecutive years, said NBS. China's R&D spending intensity, or the expenditure on R&D as a percentage of its GDP, surged to a record 2.55 percent in 2022, 0.12 percentage point higher than the 2021 level. The country's R&D spending intensity now ranks 12th among major countries in the world, surpassing several countries known for innovation including France (2.35 percent) and the Netherlands (2.32 percent), said Li Yin, a statistician with the NBS. Despite the impact of several adverse factors, the steady growth of China's R&D expenditure continues to inject strong vitality into the country's innovative development, said Li.
