China's new yuan-denominated loans hit 21.31 trillion yuan ($3.15 trillion) in 2022, up 1.36 trillion yuan from 2021, central bank data showed Tuesday. New yuan loans stood at 1.4 trillion yuan in December, seeing a rise from the previous month and beating analysts' estimates. The M2, a broad measure of money supply that covers cash in circulation and all deposits, increased 11.8 percent year on year to 266.43 trillion yuan at the end of December. The PBOC pledged to further optimize the credit structure this year and support economic development with precise and forceful policies. It also promised to keep liquidity reasonably ample and offer adequate financial services to key sectors including infrastructure investment, small and micro enterprises, technological innovation, manufacturing, and green development.
