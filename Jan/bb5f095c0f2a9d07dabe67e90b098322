Croatian President Zoran Milanovic has said the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are engaged in a proxy war against Russia through Ukraine, Croatian media reported on Monday. "Washington and NATO are waging a proxy war against Russia through Ukraine," Milanovic was quoted as saying while addressing a conference in the eastern city of Vukovar on Sunday. Milanovic also slammed Western sanctions against Russia. "The plan should not be about removing (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. The plan should not be about sanctions. Sanctions are absurd, and we can achieve nothing using them," Milanovic said, adding that the U.S. and NATO "are shifting from one war to another." The decision to train Ukrainian soldiers or any involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict should be Croatia's choice instead of being imposed by the bigger powers, Milanovic said. "What should we be? America's slaves?" he asked. Milanovic has repeatedly opposed Croatia's participation in training Ukrainian soldiers, claiming that it was "legally doubtful."
