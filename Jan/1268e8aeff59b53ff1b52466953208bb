During Spring Festival, narcissus is often the first choice for those who want to buy some flowers for decoration. Blooming early in springtime with the fragrant flower in yellow, this plant has become the symbolic flower for Chinese New Year. Narcissus represents auspiciousness and togetherness, as well as good fortune and prosperity in Chinese culture. If you want to have one, remember that the flower grows best in warmer places.
