Power networks were fully restored across Pakistan as of Tuesday morning, a day after a nationwide breakdown left the country of 220 million people without electricity. "All 1,112 grid stations restored within 24 hours nationwide," Pakistan's energy ministry tweeted on Tuesday. The outage started around 7:30 am (0230 GMT) on Monday, a failure linked to a cost-cutting measure as Pakistan grapples with an economic crisis.
