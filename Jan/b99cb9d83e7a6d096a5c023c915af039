Heavy rains which have triggered floods and landslides in the Philippines since January 1 have killed 20 people and affected over 550,000 in five regions, a government disaster agency said on Saturday. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said in a report that the rains were brought about by the combined effects of low-pressure areas, the northeast monsoon and the shear line.
