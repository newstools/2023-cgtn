China women's curling team claimed back-to-back wins on Monday, extending their winning streak to six at the 31st Winter World University Games held in Lake Placid in the U.S. Having opened the campaign with four consecutive wins, China beat Canada 7-4 earlier on Monday before dominating Great Britain 6-3. "Our conditions are better and better after six games, but it's not easy. We need to focus on ourselves and try to get a better toss every time," said player Han Yu. China now leads the round-robin phase attended by 10 teams, with the top four finishers advancing into the semifinals. The two important wins on Monday earned China a positive position on the table, which was beyond China's coach Yu Zuojun's expectations. "The team will continue this tide, we didn't set a specific goal, but we all expect a result as good as possible," Yu noted. China's next opponents are Japan, U.S. and South Korea respectively. (With input from Xinhua)
