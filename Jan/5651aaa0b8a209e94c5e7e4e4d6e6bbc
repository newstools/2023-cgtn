Beijing has launched a system for providing nucleic acid testing results in both Chinese and English, the Beijing Municipal Health Commission said on Monday. The system can facilitate people's traveling to different countries, it said. By aggregating data from the city's unified nucleic acid testing system and different laboratories' self-built systems, the newly-launched system automatically generates such a report in a template which was also used for the departing personnel after the Winter Olympics. The bilingual report will be available in the Jingtong/Jiankang Bao (Health Kit) mini program. People who complete nucleic acid testing at any sampling site in the city can download the latest report within three days after a negative test result. Meanwhile, Beijing has updated the information of more than 700 nucleic acid sampling sites on multiple map service apps for an easier sampling experience. Information including location, service hours, and hotlines are provided.
