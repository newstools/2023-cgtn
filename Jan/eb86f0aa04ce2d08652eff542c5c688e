South America's top national team competition, the Copa America, will be held in the United States in 2024 and feature 10 teams from South America's CONMEBOL and six teams from the CONCACAF region. CONMEBOL stands for the South American Football Confederation while CONCACAF means the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football. The tournament, co-organized by both organizations, will be held between June 14 and July 13, 2024. Three CONCACAF nations, the United States, Mexico and Canada, are jointly hosting the 2026 World Cup and holding a 16-team tournament two years prior is seen as the perfect appetizer for fans and a test for organizing bodies. There will also be a new collaboration in women's football with CONCACAF inviting the four best teams from South America to play in the new women's football event CONCACAF W Gold Cup in 2024. That tournament will also be held in the United States and will feature Brazil, Colombia, Argentina and Paraguay. "This is a partnership to support the ongoing growth of men's and women's football in CONCACAF and CONMEBOL, and will truly be of mutual benefit to both Confederations," said Victor Montagliani, president of CONCACAF. "Working hand in hand with CONMEBOL, we will deliver elite competitions that will provide more opportunities for our federations, and that we know passionate fans want to see," he added.
