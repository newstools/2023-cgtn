The Spring Festival is the most important traditional festival among the Chinese. It is when hundreds of millions of Chinese families at home and abroad bid farewell to the old year and get together to usher in the new. CGTN Stringer hit the streets of New York City to feel the atmosphere of the Spring Festival celebrations and ask residents about their understanding of the Chinese New Year customs as well as their wishes for the Year of the Rabbit.
