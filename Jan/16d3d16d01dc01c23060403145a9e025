A Brazilian Supreme Court judge on Friday decided to include former President Jair Bolsonaro in an investigation of the January 8 riot in the nation's capital Brasilia. Bolsonaro will be investigated for possible "instigation and intellectual authorship of the anti-democratic acts that resulted in vandalism and violence in Brasilia last Sunday," a statement posted on the top public prosecutor's website said. Thousands of Bolsonaro's supporters vandalized the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace last weekend. (With input from Reuters)
