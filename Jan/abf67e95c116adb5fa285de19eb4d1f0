Nearly two-thirds of Britons now support a referendum on rejoining the European Union (EU), according to a poll published in British newspaper The Independent. A majority of those polled said that leaving the EU has worsened the UK's economy, global influence and ability to control its own borders. According to the poll, 65 percent of Britons believe a referendum should be held on rejoining the EU, up from 55 percent a year ago.  Meanwhile, 22 percent of respondents think another referendum should be held immediately. The number of Britons who oppose the referendum on EU membership has dropped from 32 percent a year ago to 24 percent at present. Also, 54 percent of people say Brexit was the wrong decision, up from 46 percent a year ago. The UK announced its withdrawal from the EU in 2016 after a referendum and formally left the bloc on January 31, 2020.
