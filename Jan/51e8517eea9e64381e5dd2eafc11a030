China has mapped out a series of measures aimed at enabling grassroots medical facilities to promptly identify and offer treatment to patients at risk of becoming severe cases. According to a press briefing, special attention will be paid to those aged 65 and over as well as those with pre-existing conditions. Dr Alice Hyun-Kyung TAN, an Internist at MizMedi Women's Hospital in South Korea, suggested that using telemedicine or other communication tools such as 24/7 hotlines will be very important and helpful for the grassroots medical facilities to be well-prepared in the fight against COVID-19 in China.
