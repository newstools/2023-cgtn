Lively, festive and full of passion, Yangge, one of the most popular Chinese folk dances, is said to have its origins in China's farming culture. This traditional art combines music, dance and various stunts. Serving at its core as an expression of happiness and joy, yangge comes in various styles and diverse forms. In east China's Shandong, Haiyang Yangge ranks as one of the three most famous Yangge dances in the province, and is known for its distinctively humorous performing style. One striking feature of Haiyang Yangge's dance moves is its delicate combination of running and twisting, where performers would - for example - twist their waists and shake their shoulders and heads vigorously while dancing. At China Media Group's 2023 Spring Festival Gala, an acrobatics show threw the spotlight on Haiyang Yangge dance. Entitled "Me and Grandpa Walking on Stilts," the performance is based on the traditional Chinese art of stilt-walking and has incorporated numerous elements of intangible cultural heritage, including paper-cutting, flower bun-making, folk songs and Haiyang Yangge dance, offering a festive feast of China's folk arts to global audiences.
