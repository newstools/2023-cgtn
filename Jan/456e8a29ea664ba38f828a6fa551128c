The death toll from a plane crash in Nepal's Pokhara has been revised down to 68 from 69, flight operator Yeti Airlines said late on Sunday. Hundreds of rescue workers scoured the hillside where the flight carrying 72 people from the capital Kathmandu went down. Officials late in the evening called off the search operations for the day, saying they will resume on Monday.
