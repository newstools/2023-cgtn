To herald the upcoming Spring Festival, various kinds of cultural activities were held in east China's Jiangsu Province. In Yancheng, a traditional "datiehua" performance, or molten iron splashing, attracted many spectators. Together, the dedicated inheritors of the folk activity, which is also a form of intangible cultural heritage, helped to take the festive atmosphere to a new height.
