In January, Qinghai Lake in northwest China's Qinghai Province is frozen. The ice cap grows more than 40 centimeters thick. At minus 20 degrees Celsius, everything seems motionless. For most migratory birds, the warmer south is more preferable; however, hundreds of thousands of waterfowls spend winter here every year, including whooper swans. The whooper swans arrive here every October and stay until April. Their elegant postures make Qinghai Lake a true "swan lake on ice." So what persuades them to stay in the freezing Qinghai Lake? The answer is hidden in this vast white world.
