Shang Juncheng of China defeated Oscar Otte of Germany 3-1 (6-2, 6-4, 6-7(2) and 7-5) in the men's singles first-round match in the Australian Open at Melbourne Park on Monday. In his first Grand Slam trip, 17-year-old Shang made history by becoming the first player from the Chinese mainland to advance to the men's singles second round in the Australian Open since the event began 118 years ago. Shang ranks 195th on the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP's) world rankings table, while Otte is 74th. The 29-year-old participated in all the four Grand Slam tournaments, the Australian Open, Wimbledon, the French Open and the U.S. Open. His best record was reaching Round of 16 in the U.S. Open in 2021. Otte's rich experience soon helped him lead 2-1 in the first set, but then he kept making mistakes that Shang exploited to launch a counterattack. Having claimed five games in a row, Shang won the first set to lead 1-0. The second set grew closer as the two tied at 2-2 after the first four games. Shang then stole a march on Otte by winning two straight games. Though Otte immediately took one game back. However, he never overcame the deficit in this set, which he lost after the 10th game. Neither player led by more than one game in the third set, which went from 1-1 to 6-6. In the end, Otte won the tie-breaker 6-2 to keep the match alive. Shang won the fifth game in the fourth set to lead 3-2 after another 2-2 start. He and Otte exchanged in the next six games until the set entered the 12th game and Shang led 6-5. This time, he didn't let the opportunity get away and turned the first match point into the final victory. Other Chinese players competed in the Australian Open on Monday.
