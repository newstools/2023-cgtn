Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, said on Wednesday that China's rise is a "huge win for the world" during an interview with the Lowy Institute, a think tank based in Australia, according to Fox Business. "I tend to see China's rise as a huge win for the world," Gates said, adding that the portion of the Chinese people in the global population today matches their portion of the global economy. When asked about how "bullish" he was on China, he said he does think that "the current mentality of the U.S. to China and which is reciprocated is kind of a lose-lose mentality." He said it takes the whole world to work together for the global economy, for the discovery of cancer drugs and for the solution to climate change. During the interview, Gates also said that the U.S. is politically in a weak state, adding that countries like China need to play a bigger role in world governance, according to Fox Business. "The current world system is designed around U.S. leadership," he said, adding that as other countries have gotten richer, some middle-income countries including China and India need to play a stronger role in world governance.
