Thousands of people marched in the French capital, Paris, on Saturday against a plan to raise the country's retirement age from 62 to 64. Youth organizations and left-wing party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) called on residents to protest against the proposal. French President Emmanuel Macron insisted he would press ahead with the pension reforms which he says are needed to keep the pension system financially viable. Unions and demonstrators claim that the move threatens hard-won workers' rights.
