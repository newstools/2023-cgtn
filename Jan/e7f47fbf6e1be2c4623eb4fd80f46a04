On January 8, China lifted virtually all of its COVID-related restrictions for international travelers. This is great news for many reasons. We invited an Afghan student and a Saudi student from Tsinghua University, a prospective student from Vietnam, and a Guinean student from Tongji University to share their expectations about visiting China for the first time. Though online classes provided convenience and increased access, international students were ecstatic to finally meeting their classmates and professors in person in the upcoming spring semester.
