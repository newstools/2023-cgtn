The restrictions, introduced with the outbreak of the pandemic, were officially lifted on January 8, coinciding with the beginning of 2023 Chinese New Year travel rush. Billions of journeys could be made domestically and internationally during the festive season that culminates in a seven-day holiday due to start on January 21. Governments worldwide have wasted no time in charming perspective Chinese holidaymakers in the run-up to Sunday's reopening, splashing photos and videos of well-known tourist attractions across Weibo,Â China's Twitter-like network. "Chinese friends, France welcomes you with open arms," said the French Embassy on Weibo together with several photos showing the attractions of national pride for the 2024 Olympic Games host. Weibo users showered the post with 26,000 thumbs-ups.
