Better and Better is based on real stories that happened in the past year. "More … and more …" is repeatedly used in the story to express the hopes and expectations of every ordinary Chinese people for the New Year, and tells about everyone's small expectations and small happiness in life through an "unexpected but reasonable" storytelling way. The family is "more and more lively", the children are "more and more mature”, the elderly are “more and more healthy”, the Chinese are “more and more classy and confident", and life is "better and better”, which are people’s common aspiration for a better life.
