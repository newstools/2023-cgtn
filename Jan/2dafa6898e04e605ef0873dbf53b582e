For 37 years, 65-year-old Ling Jiafan has been living in Nantong Village, Qionghai City in southern China's Hainan Province as a rural doctor. There are 2,000 villagers of Miao nationality living there, and Doctor Ling knows every single one of them. They call him the "god of health protection." Since the upgraded COVID-19 policy, China has implemented tiered medical treatment to get the locals treated in time and avoid medical runs.
