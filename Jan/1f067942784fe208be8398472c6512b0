The Puxian Opera was performed on the stage of China Media Group's 2023 Spring Festival Gala. This marks the first time that this opera style has taken the stage of the Spring Festival Gala, bringing the long-lasting art form to a global audience. The Puxian Opera has a long history and can trace its origin back to the Tang and Song dynasties (618-1279) in Fujian Province. The opera was later popularized over time, and now there are more than 5,000 plays preserved in modern day times. The rich tunes of Puxian Opera tell many ancient stories and folk tales, reflecting the lifestyle and values of ancient people. The opera is sung in a Fujian dialect by performers and is accompanied by stage performances inspired by puppet shows. Its long history and rich cultural values have made Puxian Opera "a living fossil of the opera of South China." Puxian Opera was listed as an intangible cultural heritage of China in 2006. With more people taking interest in the Puxian Opera in recent years, the cultural heritage is under better protection. There are hundreds of Puxian Opera troupes in Fujian, and opera fans can easily get show tickets both online and offline.
