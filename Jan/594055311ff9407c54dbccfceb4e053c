German Chancellor Olaf Scholz accepted Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht's resignation on Monday, a government spokesperson said. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht has resigned following persistent criticism of her handling of military modernization programs and the country's arms deliveries to Ukraine. Lambrecht's successor will be announced on Tuesday, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported. Lambrecht said in a statement on Monday that "months of media focus on my person" had stood in the way of a factual debate about the military and Germany's security policy. "The valuable work of the soldiers and many people in my department must stand in the foreground," she said. (With input from Reuters)
