Two separate road crashes involving trucks in southern Nigeria have left 20 people dead, including children, authorities said, with many of the victims burned beyond recognition. In Nigeria's commercial hub of Lagos, a truck carrying a heavy container landed on a commercial bus on a busy bridge in the Ojuelegba area of the city, authorities said in a statement on Sunday. Earlier, another truck collided with a bus in the Odigbo council area of Ondo state near Lagos, killing all the passengers on board, the country's road safety agency said.
