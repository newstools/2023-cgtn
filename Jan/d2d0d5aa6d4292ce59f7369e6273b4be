Graham Arnold has signed a contract extension with Football Australia and will manage the country's national football team through the 2026 FIFA World Cup cycle, the association announced on Monday. If Australia qualify for the 2026 World Cup under Arnold, Arnold is likely to become the first manager lead the team into two World Cups. In the competitions in Qatar, they made it out of Group D with France after beating Tunisia and Denmark. Then the Socceroos lost to eventual champions Argentina in extra time in the Round of 16 game. "What Graham and the entire squad achieved under the most challenging of circumstances during the last FIFA World Cup campaign was exceptional, and we are delighted that we have secured his services for a further four years," Football Australia Chair Chris Nikou said. "Football Australia is ambitious, where we expect continued progress and results from our senior and youth national teams, and through our discussions with Graham over recent weeks, we know our thinking is aligned on the future direction of Australian football and the Subway Socceroos," Nikou added. Having led Australia to the World Cup knockout stage for the first time since 2006, Arnold received both extension offer from the association and interest from clubs in Scotland, England, the U.S. and multiple Asian leagues. In the end, the 59-year-old manager decided to return to manage the Socceroos. "I love Australia and I love Australian football, and nothing in football can ever match the elation, pride and sense of achievement, I and the entire set-up felt in Qatar," Arnold said. "The hunger to continue in the role has never been stronger and I know I have more to give to the Socceroos' program and Australian football, where I want to deliver more smiles for our fans as we did in Qatar."
