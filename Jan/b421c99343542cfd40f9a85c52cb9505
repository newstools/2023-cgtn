A 6-year-old boy was taken into police custody in the U.S. state of Virginia after he shot a teacher Friday afternoon, police chief Steve Drew told a news conference. Drew said the female teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News was shot inside a classroom. "This was not an accidental shooting," he said. The police chief said there was an altercation between the teacher and the student, who had the firearm, and that a single round was fired. No other students were involved, he added. In a Saturday statement, the Newport News Police Department said the condition of the teacher had improved, and she was listed as stable.
