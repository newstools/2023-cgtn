The Lunar New Year is one of the most important festivals in China for everyone, including the ethnic Koreans, who observe their own unique cultural and historical traditions. In Bailong Village, which borders the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, ethnic Koreans, whose ancestors migrated from the Korean Peninsula during the late 17th century, are preparing for the occasion. They have strong family values and the Lunar New Year is when families pay their respects to ancestors and elders. "We have two bird nests on the ceiling. In Korean culture, it represents family harmony and prosperity, because the birds would not come into a house if there were quarrels between family members," said Jin Jingnan, resident of Bailong Village, Tumen City, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, northeast China's Jilin Province. Bailong Village dates back nearly 150 years. In recent years, it has become somewhat of a tourist destination. Jin has turned his home into a guesthouse where visitors can experience authentic Korean culture. "I think that the improved living standards nowadays allow people to use the spare money on holidays and travels. For them, our guesthouse is like a living history museum of Korean culture," he said. As the Lunar New Year draws near, the Jin family is excited to bid farewell to the old and usher in the new. Jin's wife Quan Yuzi told CGTN, "In the past three years, tourism was hit hard by the pandemic, and so was our guesthouse. I hope the coming new year will be a year of hope and prosperity, and more visitors can come to our village." China is home to nearly 2 million people of Korean descent, who take celebrations quite seriously. Traditional festivals are celebrated heartily, especially the Lunar New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival. Other occasions for merriment are the 100th day after a baby's birth and a person's 60th birthday.
