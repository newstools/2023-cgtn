The Peruvian government late on Saturday declared a state of emergency in the capital Lima and several other regions due to protests in recent weeks. The measure, in force for 30 days from Sunday, authorizes the army to intervene to maintain order and suspends several constitutional rights, such as freedom of movement and assembly, according to a decree published in the official gazette. Supporters of ousted president Pedro Castillo have marched and barricaded streets across the South American country since December, demanding new elections and the removal of Dina Boluarte. On Friday night, she refused to step down, saying in a televised address, "My commitment is with Peru." The state of emergency covers Lima, the regions of Cusco and Puno, as well as the port of Callao, adjacent to the capital. More than 100 protest roadblocks were in place across Peru on Saturday, mainly in the south, which has been the epicenter of the unrest, and also around Lima. The mass anti-government demonstrations first broke out in early December after Castillo was ousted from office for attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, seeking to prevent an impeachment vote against him. Peru has faced political instability in recent years, with 60-year-old Boluarte being the sixth person to hold the presidency in five years.
