The 2023 Spring Festival Gala presented by China Media Group showcased a stunning dance program named "The Musical Bridge," which gave everyone a taste of the unique style of the water towns of southern China. It also brought the Chinese intangible heritage project – Dragon Dance of Anchorage Step – to the global audiences. "The Musical Bridge" was inspired by Shishui Stepping Stone Bridge in east China's Zhejiang Province, which is made up of separate pieces of stones placed in the water like the keys of a piano. The bridge, built in 1795, extends in a straight line and is the longest ancient stepping stone bridge in the world. It has a total length of 144 meters and a total of 233 stones. Each stone is divided into a high and a low level. The first performance of the dragon dance on the Shishui Stepping Stone Bridge began in the third year of Emperor Jiaqing in Qing Dynasty in 1798, and now has a history of more than 220 years. The dragon dance props are made of bamboo, covered with cloth and painted with dragon scale patterns. These bamboo pieces are connected by joints, and each joint is equipped with a wooden handle for manipulation. There are more than 60 sets of movements in the whole dragon dance, which requires extremely high endurance, agility, and cooperation between the performers. As the dragon dance performers take vigorous steps to the sonorous music, the colorful dragon and the reflection in the water complement each other like a flowing painting. The Dragon Dance of Anchorage Step was included in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2011. Besides visiting metropolitan cities on your next trip to China, these romantic spots in quiet southern water towns also beckon your visit.
