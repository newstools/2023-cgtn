Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki said Sunday that Israel revoked his travel permit. Riad Malki said in a statement that he was returning from the Brazilian president's inauguration when he was informed that Israel had rescinded his travel permit, which allows top Palestinian officials to travel easily in and out of the occupied West Bank, unlike ordinary Palestinians. A spokesperson for Israel's defense ministry confirmed the move to the Reuters news agency, calling it part of the implementation of a government decision taken on Friday to penalize the Palestinians for pushing the United Nations' highest judicial body to give its opinion on the Israeli occupation.
