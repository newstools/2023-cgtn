China is returning to its pre-pandemic hustle and bustle as the country's recently adjusted COVID-19 response policy promotes the resumption of work and production, driving a surge in passenger levels. More than 5.5 million passengers traveled by national railways on 6,368 passenger trains on Saturday, data from China Railway showed. The company expects to transport 4.7 million passengers on Sunday. China's loosened COVID-19 restrictions have boosted tourism, with China's online travel agency Trip.com reporting a 177 percent increase in ticket bookings for scenic spots in Beijing from December 19 to 23 compared to the previous week. Train tickets for China's upcoming Spring Festival travel rush went on sale since December 24 and have seen high demand. The number of searches for train tickets rose rapidly, reaching more than 80 percent of the same period in 2019, according to online travel services provider Tongcheng Travel. "Signs of improvement in public travel have appeared recently," said Dong Zhongyun, chief economist at China AVIC Securities. "With people traveling more and transport and flight services getting livelier, the country's economic recovery is expected to accelerate." Travel and other activities are expected to recover to pre-Omicron levels in March, noted Robin Xing, chief China economist with Morgan Stanley. With better foundations and more advantages shoring up growth, China is confident of achieving an overall recovery and improvement in its economic performance in 2023, said Zhao Chenxin, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission.
