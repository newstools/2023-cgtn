Shanghai Port remained the world's busiest container port for the 13th straight year in 2022, despite the COVID-19 epidemic, port data showed Monday. The port's container throughput exceeded 47.3 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 2022, according to Shanghai International Port (Group) Co., Ltd., the port operator. Braving the epidemic, as well as waves of heat and cold last year, the port guaranteed the stable operation of Shanghai International Shipping Center and safeguarded the stability of global industrial and supply chains. Following the epidemic in the second quarter, the port managed to quickly make a V-shaped recovery in container throughput, when it handled a monthly record high of 4.3 million TEUs in July.
