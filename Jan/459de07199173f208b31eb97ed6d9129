Naamyam is a unique tradition of local narrative singing in the Cantonese dialect that integrates vocal and instrumental music. As one of the most ancient types of music in China, the existing repertoire is composed mainly of vocal pieces with a simple, elegant and delicate musical style. Naamyam is a continuation of the Chinese ritual and music system in its community, and its repertoire and lyrics widely reflect Confucian social and ethical values. A Naamyam performer usually sings accompanied by an instrument such as a guzheng (Chinese plucked zither), yehu (bowed string instrument) and ban (wooden clappers). There is no fixed limit to the length of each song, lasting from ten minutes to several hours. Naamyam songs are usually lyrical, focusing on expressing emotions and thoughts rather than telling a complex story. In 2006, Naamyam was included in the National List for Intangible Cultural Heritage. In 2009, it was inscribed on the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. In this yearâ€™s Spring Festival Evening Gala, a pop music singer and Naamyam performers cooperated to light up the treasures of the intangible cultural heritage.
