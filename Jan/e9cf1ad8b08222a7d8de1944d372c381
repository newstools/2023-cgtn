Eleven people were killed on Sunday when a residential building collapsed in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo, state news agency SANA reported. The five-storey building housing about 30 people collapsed due to a water leakage affecting its foundation. Rescuers are still working on finding survivors, according to SANA.
