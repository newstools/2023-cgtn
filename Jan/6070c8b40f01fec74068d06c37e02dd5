One person was killed and dozens injured Thursday when a stampede broke out outside a football stadium in Iraq hours before the Gulf Cup final, medical and security sources said. Thousands of fans without tickets had gathered outside the stadium in Iraq's main southern city of Basra since dawn in the hope of watching the rare home international match between Iraq and Oman, which was due to kick off at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT). "There has been one death and dozens of slight injuries," a medic said. An interior ministry official gave the same toll.
