A respiratory expert in Beijing advised that elderly people in China should not stay at home all the time, just to avoid contracting COVID-19. "Older people's social needs usually cannot be satisfied through the use of internet," said Li Yanming, head of respiratory department at Beijing Hospital, during a press conference on Monday. "Staying at home for too long may affect their mentality." Li said she understands that respectful children want to protect the elderly in their families, but avoiding going out is not a good idea. "They can try going out less often," she told CGTN. "Of course, they should protect themselves by washing hands, wearing masks and getting the COVID-19 vaccines." People can also decide whether they should go out by checking the infection trend in their local area, recent infections in neighborhoods, their age, underlying health conditions and personal will, she added.
