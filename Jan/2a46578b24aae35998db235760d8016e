He accused the U.S. of preparing the ground for the conflict in Ukraine as part of what he called a hybrid war against Moscow. "The amount of Western support clearly shows that the West has invested a lot in its war against Russia," Lavrov said. Russia began what it calls a "special military operation" in Ukraine on February 24, 2022 while Kyiv and its Western allies described it as an aggression to grab land.
