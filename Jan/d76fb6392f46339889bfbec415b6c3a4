At least one person died in clashes in the southern Peruvian town of Macusani between police and protesters, a local hospital said in a statement Wednesday. The 35-year-old woman "was admitted to emergency services without vital signs," the San Martin de Porres hospital said. Her death brings the total number since the beginning of the protests in December to 43.
