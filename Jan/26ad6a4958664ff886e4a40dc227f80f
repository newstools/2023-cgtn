Coach Erik ten Hag criticized Manchester United's lack of killer instinct after Michael Olise's superb stoppage-time free-kick rescued a 1-1 draw for Crystal Palace on Wednesday. Ten Hag's side led through Bruno Fernandes' first half strike at Selhurst Park as they looked to record their longest winning streak in 14 years. But Olise halted United's run at nine successive victories in all competitions when he smashed a breathtaking set-piece past David de Gea in the final seconds. It was a major blow for United, who had hoped to climb to second place in the Premier League and put pressure on leaders Arsenal ahead of their visit to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. "When you're winning with two minutes to go and Palace don't create anything except one from a corner and one from the free-kick, you don't expect to drop points," Ten Hag said. "We have to invest more to get that second goal and then not be in that situation that a lucky moment costs you. In the second half we had a lot of space to kill them and go for the second goal," he added. "I never saw we really went for the second goal. It's difficult to say why. I have to criticize my team. Go for the second." Manchester City topped Deloitte's Football Money League for a second consecutive year as the Premier League accounted for more than half of the top 20 clubs for the first time. Total revenue from the top 20 revenue generating clubs rose to near pre-pandemic levels of 9.2 billion euros ($9.9 billion) for the 2021/22 season, according to a report published on Thursday. That increase was largely due to a 1.3 billion euro rise in matchday revenue after two seasons impacted by coronavirus restrictions. The Premier League's rise in international television rights sales and strong commercial growth saw 11 clubs from the English top-flight make the top 20 for the first time.
