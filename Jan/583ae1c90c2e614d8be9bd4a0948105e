The death toll from the blast at a mosque next to the police lines in Peshawar, northwest of Pakistan, reached 100 following the completion of rescue operations to retrieve the bodies from under the rubble, Pakistani media outlet Geo TV reported on Tuesday. "There are 53 injured at the hospital [and] seven are in critical condition at the intensive care unit," said the report, citing a spokesman from Peshawar's Lady Reading Hospital. At least 221 people were injured in the massive explosion, out of which more than 100 have been discharged after receiving necessary medical aid at the hospital. A suicide bomber blew himself up in the mosque in aÂ tightly guarded police compound at around 1 p.m. on Monday, causing the roof to collapse upon the prayers.
