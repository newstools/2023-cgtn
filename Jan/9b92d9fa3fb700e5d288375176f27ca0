Zhang Shuai of China beat Katie Volynets of the U.S. 2-0 (6-3 and 6-2) in the women's singles third round at the Australian Open at Melbourne Park on Saturday to advance to the Round of 16 in the Grand Slam tournament. Zhang served herself a great birthday present with an incredible performance. The last time Zhang went so far in the Australian Open was in 2016 when she came back to beat Madison Keys of the U.S. 2-1 (3-6, 6-3 and 6-3) and reached the quarterfinals. Seven years later, 33-year-old Zhang, the No. 23 seed, will play No. 30 seed Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic for a spot in the quarterfinals. Zhang began Saturday's match by breaking Volynets' first serve. Having held all four of her service games to lead 5-3, Zhang scored another break point in less than two minutes to win the ninth game as well as the first set. Zhang continued to charge aggressively in the second set. With a 3-2 lead after five games, she won two consecutive break points and held her own serve to claim a one-sided victory over Volynets. Earlier on Saturday, Zhang's compatriot Zhu Lin upset the tournament's No. 6 seed Maria Sakkari of Greece 2-1 (7-6 (3), 1-6 and 6-4) in another women's singles third-round match. Zhu will face the No. 24 seed, Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, in the Round of 16.
