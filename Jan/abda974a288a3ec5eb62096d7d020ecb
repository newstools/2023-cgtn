British commuters are bracing for more railway disruption after the UK's National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) stated that strikes will continue after the government blocked union members from negotiating with employers. Around 40,000 workers from 14 British train operators waged a strike on Wednesday demanding better pay and conditions, bringing most rail services across the country to a halt. The recent strikes are driven by growing social tensions due to high inflation and the soaring cost of living.
