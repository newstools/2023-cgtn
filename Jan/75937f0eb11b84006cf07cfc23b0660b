The Shenzhou-15 taikonauts Fei Junlong, Deng Qingming and Zhang Lu sent their Spring Festival greetings from China Space Station in a video released by the China Manned Space Agency on New Year's Eve. The trio, dressed in blue jumpsuits with dark red patterns, each held a sticker showing their own calligraphy. Two of the stickers were written with the Chinese character "fu," meaning good luck, and the other had good luck wishes from Tiangong. "Wearing new clothes, eating dumplings and sending blessings â€” the festive customs and atmosphere are the same here," said Zhang. The taikonauts have decorated the orbiting space station, about 400 kilometers above Earth, with red couplets and Chinese knots.
