Russia's Defense MinistryÂ said on Friday that its forces have captured the salt-mining town of Soledar. "On the evening of January 12, the liberation of the city of Soledar was completed, which is important for the continuation of successful offensive operations" in Donetsk, the defense ministry said. Kyiv, however, denied that Russia was in control of the eastern town, saying heavy fighting was ongoing. "Severe fighting is going on in Soledar," said Sergiy Cherevaty, a spokesman for the eastern group of the Ukrainian armed forces. "Ukraine's armed forces have the situation under control in difficult conditions." (With input from AFP)
