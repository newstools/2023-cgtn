A Shaolin kung fu program at the 2023 Spring Festival Gala aired by China Media Group impressed the audience with China's profound traditional culture of martial arts. In the performance, Shaolin Temple warrior monks and the students from the Henan Shaolin Temple Tagou Martial Arts School joined action movie star Zhao Wenzhuo to demonstrate Chinese kung fu to a global audience. The five-minute performance highly embodied the scene from a wall painting of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) called "Warrior Monks in Action". In the wall painting, 34 warrior monks practice in pairs, with seemingly lifelike movements that showcase a grand martial arts practice scene. Like all kung fu styles, the Shaolin kung fu, which originated from Chan Buddhism, uses kicks, blocks and punches to stop opponents. The movements are based on the medical knowledge of ancient China and conforms to the rules of movement of the human body. This martial arts form emphasizes the combination of movement and stillness, the balance between “yin” and “yang,” the complement of toughness and softness, and the inclusion of the spirit and the form. Shaolin kung fu was listed as a Chinese national-level intangible cultural heritage in 2006 and its cradle place - the Shaolin Temple and its Pagoda Forest - were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010.
