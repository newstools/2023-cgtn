Ambulance services were called to Sydney airport on Wednesday afternoon to meet an incoming Qantas plane that had issued a mid-air mayday alert. The flight, QF144, was believed to be carrying more than 100 passengers from New Zealand, an ambulance spokesperson said. The plane appeared to land safely at Sydney airport before coming to a stop on the runway, television images from public broadcaster ABC showed. The New South Wales Ambulance earlier said they were on standby at the airport as part of their "emergency activation" plans, after the plane issued a mid-air mayday call over the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand.
