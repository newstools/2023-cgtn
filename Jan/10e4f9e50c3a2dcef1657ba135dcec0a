Colombia and the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group said on Saturday they will resume peace talks in Mexico next month, overcoming a recent impasse that followed the government declaring and then calling off a bilateral ceasefire. The two sides held an emergency meeting in Caracas in the past week and agreed to hold the second round of negotiations on February 13 in the Central American nation.
