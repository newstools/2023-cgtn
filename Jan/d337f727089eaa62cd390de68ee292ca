Dhia Nemri is a Tunisian vlogger living in Hangzhou, east China's Zhejiang Province. He has been in China for six years. In this video, Nemri shares what he has seen in China during the last three years of fighting the COVID-19 epidemic. He doesn't think that foreign media's reports on China's epidemic prevention policies are really accurate, and only by actually living in China can one see the results of epidemic prevention. At the same time, Nemri also wants to pay tribute to the people who have been working behind the scenes for the past three years.
