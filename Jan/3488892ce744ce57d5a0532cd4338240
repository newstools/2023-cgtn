Travel agencies and online travel companies' outbound group travel and "air ticket + hotel" businesses for Chinese citizens to the relevant countries will be pilot reinstated on February 6, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced on Friday. The relevant list of countries includes Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Laos, UAE, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Russia, Switzerland, Hungary, New Zealand, Fiji, Cuba and Argentina. Soon after China downgraded its COVID-19 management measures, many Chinese tourists embarked on outbound travels. The global tourism market has responded warmly to this change and actively welcomed Chinese tourists. It is expected that during the Spring Festival this year, overseas tourist destinations will welcome a large number of Chinese tourists going abroad. Travel agencies and online travel companies can carry out product launches, publicity and promotion, and other preparatory work starting February 6, 2023.
