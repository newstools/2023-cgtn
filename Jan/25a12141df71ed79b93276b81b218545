Ma Xiaowei, minister of China's National Health Commission (NHC), talked over the phone with World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, exchanging views on the current COVID-19 prevention and control measures. Ma said that China had shared information with the WHO and other countries since the beginning of the epidemic, was the first to identify the pathogen and share its genetic sequence, and established a mechanism for technical exchange with the WHO. Since China took the initiative to optimize and adjust its epidemic prevention and control policies in light of the current situation, the two sides have conducted many technical exchanges, Ma said, adding that China will continue to support the WHO in the fight against COVID-19.
