The U.S. has announced that it will provide 31 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, fulfilling a request from Kyiv for heavy Western tanks for months. Washington's pledge came hours after Germany reportedly sought a U.S. commitment of tanks before agreeing to send its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Zhang Xin, an associate professor of the School of Politics and International Relations at East China Normal University, says the tank delivery means a higher level of involvement of Western countries.
