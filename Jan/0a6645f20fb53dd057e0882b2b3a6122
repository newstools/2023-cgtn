A C919 airliner, China's first homegrown large jetliner, landed at Meilan International Airport in Haikou City, south China's Hainan Province, on January 2 as part of its 100-hour validation flight process. This testing process will comprehensively verify the airliner's reliability, with commercial operation in consideration, to ensure its safety and efficiency and provide good flight experience for passengers. It is the first time that China's civil aviation transport market has a self-developed mainline jetliner.
