China plans to launch a Queqiao-2 satellite in 2024 to provide relay communication services for Chang'e-6, 7 and 8 lunar missions, according to China National Space Administration (CNSA). Wang Qiong, deputy chief designer of the Chang'e-6 mission, told China Media Group (CMG) that the Chang'e-6 probe, which serves as a backup for the Chang'e-5 probe, is planned to undertake a lunar sample collection mission on the far side of the moon from 2024 to 2025. Since direct communication with the far side of the moon is not possible, Chang'e-6 will need a relay satellite to support its work. So China will launch the Queqiao-2 in 2024 for the lunar mission, said Hu Hao, chief designer of the third phase of China's lunar exploration project and also chief designer of Chang'e-6. Compared with Chang'e-4 relay satellite Queqiao, the Queqiao-2 will have a greater improvement in overall level and capability, Hu added. The designed lifespan of Queqiao is about to end, and China plans to launch Queqiao-2 in 2024 before the Chang'e-6 mission for the country's phase-4 lunar mission, serving Chang'e-6, 7 and 8, Wang added. Launched in 2022, the phase-4 lunar mission will conduct scientific exploration at the lunar south pole to facilitate the construction of a basic structure for the International Lunar Research Station in the area by 2035. Wang further said that the goal of Chang'e-6 is to make technological breakthroughs in retrograde orbit design, intelligent sampling, take-off and ascent as well as automatic sampling and return from the moon's backside, besides carrying out effective international cooperation.
