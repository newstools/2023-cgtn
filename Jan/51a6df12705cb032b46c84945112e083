The families of the victims of the deadly 2020 Beirut port explosion rallied on January 26 to support Judge Tarek Bitar, who recently resumed his investigation into the tragedy. The investigation was on thin ice after Lebanon's top prosecutor, Ghassan Oueidat, accused Bitar of "insubordination" before ordering the release of all incarcerated suspects, while imposing travel bans on them and the judge himself. Earlier this week, Bitar indicted several powerful figures in connection with the blast, including Oueidat, a former prime minister, and several intelligence and security officials.
