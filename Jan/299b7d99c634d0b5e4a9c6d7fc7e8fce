China's criterion on counting COVID-19 deaths is consistent with that of the World Health Organization and other major countries, Jiao Yahui, head of the Bureau of Medical Administration under the National Health Commission (NHC), said on Saturday. The causes of death from COVID-19 are divided into two categories, one was people who died of respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 infection directly, and the other was deaths from underlying diseases combined with COVID-19 infection, Jiao told CGTN during a press conference. China has been counting respiratory failure caused by the novel coronavirus after a positive COVID-19 test, Jiao added. The country reported a total of 59,938 COVID-related deaths between December 8, 2022, and January 12 this year from medical institutions, Jiao said. Their average age was 80.3 years, and 90.1 percent of fatalities were above 65 years old. More than 90 percent of deaths came from an infection with underlying conditions, according to Jiao. Treatment of critically-ill COVID-19 patients The number of critically-ill COVID-19 patients in hospitals has shown a slow decline these days, though is still at a high level, Jiao told CGTN during a press conference, giving the number of 105,000 on January 12, and 128,000 on January 5, respectively. The utilization rate of intensive care beds in China was 75.3 percent, which "can meet the needs of treating COVID-19 patients," Jiao said. Of all the severe cases in hospital, Jiao said most of them were old people infected with underlying cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, endocrine and respiratory diseases. China's peak of fever clinics and emergency rooms passed The peak of fever clinics and emergency departments across the country has passed, and normal diagnosis and treatment in outpatient clinics is recovering, according to Jiao. Jiao said the number of people seeking treatment at fever clinics nationwide peaked on December 23, 2022 at about 2.87 million, and falling to 477,000 on January 12, a decrease of 83.3 percent compared with the peak. The number of cases in emergency departments also showed a downward trend, with a decline of 28.4 percent to 1.09 million recently. The outpatient clinics have "basically" returned to the pre-epidemic levels, Jiao said, adding that the number of outpatients across the country reached at around 9.14 million on January 12.
