Cloisonne enamel is a cultural icon of China and is listed as an intangible world heritage. Today I came to a workshop to learn from an artist about the art of making cloisonne objects. Look at this cute rabbit holding a fish! Do you like itï¼Ÿ It is so amazing to make it! And I wish you a prosperous Year of the Rabbit!
