Ali from Syria has been living in China for six years. He has witnessed the full process of the Chinese people's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, and he's been impressed by the collaboration and unity they have shown during these difficult times. "When COVID first appeared in China, the government was very wise to take strict and quick measures in order to protect its citizens and prevent the epidemic from spreading," he said. He also finds it amazing that China has recently adjusted its COVID-19 policies in order to facilitate people's travel and work. "Life here in China is always beautiful and convenient," he said, "sometimes I see Western news that is far from reality and doesn't accurately reflect the situation here."
