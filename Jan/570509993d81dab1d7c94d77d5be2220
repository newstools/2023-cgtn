Xiaonian, or "Minor New Year," fell on January 14 this year in northern China, or January 15 in southern China. Considered a prologue to Spring Festival, it jumpstarts the countdown to the Chinese New Year, reminding people to gear up for the most important holiday of the year. On this occassion, a group of intangible cultural heritage inheritors, including masters in paper cutting, Taishan shadow plays, Beijing embroidery and Beijing silk figurines, gathered at a fair in the Chinese capital to give locals and tourists an unprecedented cultural feast. Showcasing traditional handicrafts, delicious snacks, derivative artworks and more, the event, dubbed "You You Shi Ji," was designed to give visitors immersive experiences and bring them closer to the enchanting power of Chinese aesthetics and culture. The fair drew many visitors and proved a huge hit with both adults and children.
