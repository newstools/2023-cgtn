China has been expanding its medical supplies to meet the recent surge in demand for COVID-19 drugs, analgesics and machines, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) at a press conference on Wednesday. The nation has cumulatively manufactured 5.14 billion tablets of key analgesics drugs, including ibuprofen and acetaminophen, since January 1, with a daily supply of 200 million tablets for 17 consecutive days, which can be sufficient for the market demand, said Tian Yulong, chief engineer of MIIT. Tian said the daily output of the domestic COVID-19 drug Azvudine has risen by 148 percent compared to before January 1, reaching 744,000 bottles. At the conference, Tian said the daily output of invasive ventilators has increased by 239 percent, with 1,808 units, compared with that before January 1. The daily production of oxygen generators has risen by 280 percent within four days, as the maximum daily output can exceed 20,000 units. The supply of the finger-clip pulse oximeter can reach 460,000 units, meeting the demand from medical organizations and individuals. He said the country has also cooperated with related organizations to secure medical supplies online that can provide convenient access for key groups, such as the elderly, people in suburbs and young people in schools. "Over 800 poverty-alleviated counties have received over 10,000 donated oxygen generators, covering over 10,000 townships." The country is also working with organizations related to China's transportation and postal services to help people in rural areas obtain medical supplies quickly.
