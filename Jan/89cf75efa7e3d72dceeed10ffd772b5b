Holders Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup after losing 2-1 at Brighton & Hove Albion in the fourth round on Sunday, as 25-year-old Japanese winger Kaoru Mitoma struck the winning goal in stoppage time. The Reds are the third consecutive holders to go out at this stage, after Arsenal in 2020-21 and Leicester City in 2021-22. Harvey Elliott put Liverpool ahead, Lewis Dunk equalized before half-time and the score stayed at 1-1 until Mitoma found the net in the 92nd minute with a fine finish. It was the second time Brighton defeated Liverpool in January, having also beaten Jurgen Klopp's side 3-0 in an English Premier League game which he called the worst in his reign. "We feel like we can beat anyone on our best days and we showed here we can beat them on our not-so-good days. We've got everything in our squad to keep pushing on and hopefully we can go further in the competition," Dunk said after the game. It was another disappointing result for Liverpool who have struggled with form and injuries this season and are ninth in the Premier League standings. "This season has been nowhere near good enough. At the start of the year, we wanted a fresh start but that hasn't happened. We've been worse," Liverpool defender Andy Robertson said. Earlier, fifth-tier Wrexham were held to a thrilling 3-3 draw by 10-man Sheffield United. In a frantic second half, Wrexham twice took the lead through Thomas O'Connor and Paul Mullin on either side of a sending-off for Daniel Jebbison, but the Welsh club were pegged back by goals from Oliver Norwood and John Egan, who scored in the fifth minute of stoppage time.
