Leading new-energy vehicle (NEV) manufacturers in China reported a robust sales increase in 2022 thanks to fast market expansion and policy incentives, financial statements of the companies showed. BYD, China's largest NEV manufacturer, said its NEV sales in 2022 jumped 208.6 percent year on year to over 1.86 million units, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing. Startup carmakers like Li Auto and NIO also reported a fruitful year. Li Auto delivered 133,246 NEVs last year, up 47.2 percent from 2021 levels. NIO delivered 122,486 units in the same period, an annual increase of 34 percent. GAC Aion, a NEV subsidiary of GAC Group, sold some 271,000 vehicles in 2022, up 126 percent from the previous year. Gu Huinan, general manager of the company, said GAC Aion is eyeing to deliver at least 500,000 units this year. China's NEV sales should hit 6.7 million units in 2022, almost doubling the same-period level of the previous year, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers predicted in early December. The industry body had forecast NEV sales in China this year to hit 9 million units, a year-on-year increase of 35 percent. (Source: Xinhua with edits)
