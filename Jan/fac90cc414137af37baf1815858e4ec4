The 7th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) concluded on Tuesday in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where representatives from 33 member states signed and issued the "Buenos Aires Declaration". The declaration stresses the commitment of CELAC member states to jointly safeguard the rights and interests of the people in the region and to accelerate the realization of regional integration. It also pointed out that the blockade, isolation and sanctions imposed by the United States on Cuba, Venezuela and other Latin American countries violated international law and seriously damaged the rights and interests of the people ofÂ these countries, and called on the U.S. to stop its inappropriate behaviors as soon as possible. Regarding the issue of the Malvinas Islands, also known as the Falklands, the declaration noted that CELAC member states firmly support Argentina's sovereignty claims on the Malvinas Islands, called on the United Kingdom to restart negotiations with Argentina, and find a peaceful solution on the issue in accordance with relevant UN resolutions. Established in December 2011 in Caracas, Venezuela, CELAC is a block of 33 countries, including all South American countries, some Caribbean states and Mexico, and representing some 600 million people.
