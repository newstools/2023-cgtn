Do you work away from your hometown? What local food do you eat when you head back? For people in Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality, it would be tofu pudding – fresh and tender, spicy and appetizing. In Zigong City of Sichuan, Rao Youyi and his father have run their tofu pudding shop for 20 years. As the Spring Festival is around the corner, Zigong people who live in other cities, look forward to a bowl of steaming tofu pudding at home for the Lunar New Year. The feelings that diners have for tofu pudding are also the driving force for the Raos' business. As Rao Youyi said, "You have been away for a long time, and you always want a bite of delicious local food when you come back".
