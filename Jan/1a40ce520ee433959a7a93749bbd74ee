Goods with rabbit elements have become top sellers in China as the Year of Rabbit approaches, while health products stand out as Chinese people embrace the Spring Festival after the country optimized and refined its COVID-19 response. Healthcare products are selling well, a drugstore salesperson told Chinanews.com, adding that Vitamin C, protein powder and calcium tablets are popular. Noting that most of the customers are youngsters, the salesperson said many bought the products to give to the elderly, including their grandparents. For example, a man surnamed Xu, who was born in the 2000s, bought 100 cans of yellow peaches for his grandparents and other relatives. The canned yellow peach, rich in Vitamin C, is popular among Chinese citizens, as it is recommended for "good health and strong immunity." In Shunba Village, Hangzhou City in east China's Zhejiang Province, a young man surnamed Zhang bought oximeters, N95 masks and antigen tests and sent them to 24 elderly villagers, who could not shop online, from his hometown for free. Besides, health and nutrition have become a new trend for this year's Chinese New Year's Eve dinner. According to Taobao, China's leading e-commerce platform, searches for flower gelatin chicken and king crab have both doubled from the previous month. As usual, the Year of the Rabbit has led to rabbit-related Spring Festival goods becoming popular. Data from another Chinese major e-commerce platform, JD.com, show that since the end of December, products related to the Year of the Rabbit have increased by 30 times year on year.
