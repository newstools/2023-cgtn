Unidentified assailants in eastern Mali have abducted a doctor working for the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN agency said in a statement on Tuesday. Dr Mahamadou Diawara was taken from his car on Monday in the town of Menaka, located in an eastern region where militant groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State are active. The WHO is "working with local authorities to investigate the abduction and ensure our colleague's quick return to his family," the statement said.
