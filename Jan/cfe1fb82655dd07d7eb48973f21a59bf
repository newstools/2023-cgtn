In 1995, an armband dating back around 1,800 years was unearthed at the Niya Ruins in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, marking one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of the 20th century. Embroidered on the upper and lower quadrants of the precious band are eight characters, which literally mean "Five stars rising in the east favor the Middle Kingdom". The "five stars" might refer to the planets of Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars and Saturn, which on rare occasion all align to rise in the east, and the "Middle Kingdom" refers to present day China. Five interwoven layers make up the item, which has six fastening straps. This national treasure has five different colors of thread - blue, green, red, yellow and white - delicately woven into marvelous images and characters. The various patterns include clouds, mountains, stars, grasslands, beasts and birds. The fineness of the weave is believed to have indicated the highest standards of craftsmanship in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The arm protector is regarded as a witness of cultural exchanges that took place along the ancient Silk Road. The item is listed as a first-class cultural heritage of China and has been restricted from being exhibited overseas. In 2018, the China National Silk Museum successfully used Han Dynasty's (202 BCâ€“220 AD) weaving techniques to replicate the rare brocade. A dance piece was inspired by this arm protector in 2021, presenting the history of the delicate item on stage. At the 2023 Spring Festival Gala, a themed dance show was staged for global audiences, where elegant dancers combined to "weave" a "Glorious Tapestry", bringing this striking example of China's cultural heritage to life.
