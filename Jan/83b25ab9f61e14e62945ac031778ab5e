This is a resonance of both Chinese folk art and traditional delicacies. "Huamo," or flowery steamed buns, have served as a well-received food item for significant ceremonies or on festive occasions, especially for the Spring Festival. Popular in northern China, the centuries-old artistic delicacy features the ornate designs of a variety of flowers and auspicious animals that are believed to be a wish for a good life in the year ahead. The dough food item has been listed as a form of intangible cultural heritage in China.
