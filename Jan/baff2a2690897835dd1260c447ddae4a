The day started off very well for this pied kingfisher, who was hovering over a small lake on the Hainan University campus. The photos below show how the bird swooped into the water and caught its breakfast before triumphantly showing it off. The pied kingfisher is a species of water kingfisher found across Africa and Asia.
