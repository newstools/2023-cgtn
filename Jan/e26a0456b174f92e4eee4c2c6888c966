China stresses its open and transparent attitude on sharing COVID-19-related information and vows to keep doing so, the National Health Commission said on Tuesday at a press conference. Mi Feng, the spokesperson for the National Health Commission, said China has maintained pragmatic exchanges and cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other countries and regions in the world. China has held two technical exchange meetings with the WHO since it optimized its COVID-19 control measures, one on December 9 and the other on December 30, 2022. Experts exchanged in-depth views on the status of the development of the pandemic, medical treatment, vaccination and other technical issues, according to Mi. The country has held more than 60 meetings on the prevention and control of COVID-19 over the past three years, with topics on medical treatment, vaccine research and development, and virus tracing, Mi said. "China has shared its experience on COVID-19 prevention and control measures without reservation," he added. The country is also promoting its COVID-19 treatment of integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. "Based on three years of experience, we have formed a unique plan to treat COVID-19 by combining the use of both Western medicine and TCM," said Huang Luqi, deputy head of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. He said TCM treatment can speed up recovery for those with mild symptoms and prevent those with severe symptoms from developing into more critical conditions, thus reducing the mortality rate.
