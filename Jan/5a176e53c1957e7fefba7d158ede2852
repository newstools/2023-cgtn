The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says preliminary work has traced a computer outage that forced it to suspend all departures nationwide to a damaged database file, and there is no evidence of a cyber attack, the agency tweeted on Wednesday. The U.S. aviation sector was struggling to return to normal on Wednesday following the 90-minute ground stop imposed by the FAA.
