The U.S. city of Memphis on Friday released graphic video footage showing the fatal police assault of a 29-year-old Black man, as cities braced for a night of protests against police brutality. The newly-released footage from police body cameras shows a group of officers detaining Nichols, attempting to take him down with the use of a Taser, then giving chase as he evades them.
