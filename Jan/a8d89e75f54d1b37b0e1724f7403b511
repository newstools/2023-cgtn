China talked with the World Health Organization (WHO) about technologies that can help control the COVID-19 pandemic via video link on December 30, 2022. Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), confirmed the event on Tuesday, saying that China has been sharing data with the world since the pandemic began. According to the official website of China's health ministry, the online meeting between China and the WHO was about the current situation and COVID-19 treatment and vaccination plans. Cao Xuetao, deputy head of China's National Health Commission (NHC), and Shen Hongbing, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), attended the meeting, along with other officials and experts. China and the WHO agreed to cooperate on technology and help bring an end to the pandemic. "We noticed that health experts in many countries are saying that it's not necessary to put extra restrictions on people coming from China because the variants in China are already circulating around the world," Mao said during a routine press briefing. "Countries should not carry out discriminative actions or political manipulation," she said. "They shouldn't limit people's normal communication and cooperation."
