The Tibetan partridge is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. They spend the winter at 4,000 meters above sea level. They can only survive the winter by eating more. Waking up early means more foraging time. As the sun rises, they arrive at the foraging ground looking for delicacies. Check out the video to see how they survive the harsh winter!
