The Suzhou Art Museum in Jiangsu Province held a series of shadow puppet performances and related activities during the ongoing Spring Festival holiday to entertain local residents and treat them to the alluring charm of this traditional art form. Shadow puppetry is a traditional form of storytelling and entertainment that relies on the interplay of flat cutout figures, light, and a translucent screen. In a dark theatre, artists use the flat figures to portray different characters, moving between a source of light and a translucent screen or curtain, accompanied by oral scripts, singing and music to create a vivid drama. A talented artist can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and even laugh. Shadow plays have a long history in Asia and this popular folk tradition has been cultivated for many centuries in China. Artists master special techniques such as improvisational singing, performing in falsetto, the simultaneous manipulation of several puppets, and the ability to play various musical instruments. Many Chinese theatres provide shadow play performances to promote cultural values and entertain the public.
