The 2023 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the world's premier tech show, will take place in the U.S. city of Las Vegas this week from January 5 to 8, drawing over 3,100 exhibitors from 170 countries and regions, according to the organizer Consumer Technology Association. The CES has traditionally been known as a platform where companies highlight new television technology, laptops, smart phones and other such products. However, there are some emerging trends to look forward to at this year's show, such as health and wellness solutions, which have been gaining popularity in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At CES 2022, Omron Healthcare launched its highly-anticipated HeartGuide, the first wearable blood pressure monitor with EKG capability in a single device. Samsung and Intel also highlighted the importance of patient-generated data and leveraging AI in healthcare. The World Health Organization once predicted that 2020-2030 could be the decade when digital technologies reshape the global health system. In an industrial report, Grand View Research, a U.S. consultancy, also said that the scale of global digital medical market would reach $155.1 billion in 2027. This year, the Digital Health Studio will be the focal point of digital health at CES, providing sponsorship opportunities and curated conversations to the attendees. "The digital health summit is a very prominent part of the overall experience. We're starting to see the lines between regulated medical devices and health, wellness, lifestyle devices converge," said Joel Goldsmith, director of the Digital Platform of Abbott Diabetes Care. In addition, state-of-the-art electric vehicles, AI and robotics will be the recurring themes at CES 2023. (With input from Xinhua)
