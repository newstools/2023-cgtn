The Chinese embassy and consulates in Japan have suspended the issuance of ordinary visas for Japanese citizens wishing to visit China, the Chinese Embassy in Japan said on Tuesday. The Chinese Embassy in South Korea also issued a notice on the same day, suspending the issuance of short-term visas to South Korean citizens visiting China for business, tourism, medical treatment, transit or general private affairs. During Tuesday's regular press conference, China's Foreign Ministry said some countries, disregarding science, facts and their actual epidemic situation, have insisted on taking discriminatory entry restriction measures targeting China. "China firmly rejects this and will take reciprocal measures," said spokesperson Wang Wenbin. Since China announced the decision to manage COVID-19 with measures against Class-B infectious diseases and adopted provisional measures on cross-border travel,â€‚many countries have expressed their welcome, but a few countries have announced entry restriction measures targeting travelers from China, he said. "We once again call on relevant countries to make sure that their COVID response measures are fact-based, science-based and proportionate. COVID response should not be used as a pretext for political manipulation," he said. (Cover: The Chinese Embassy in Japan.)
