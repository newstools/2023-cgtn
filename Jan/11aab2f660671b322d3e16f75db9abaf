China's first national hydrogen power quality supervision and inspection center was put into use in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality on Monday. The newly built center will test the fuel cells of vehicles, hydrogen quality and motor batteries, covering the whole industrial chain of hydrogen energy. The center fills the gap in the field of hydrogen energy testing in China. Chao Peipei, director of China Automotive Engineering Research Institute Co., LTD. (CAERI), said that there are over 200 testing projects currently underway. A big data platform of hydrogen energy production, storage, transportation, processing and vehicle scheduling has been developed, Chao said, adding that it will help support the development of the hydrogen energy industry.
