China's fastest, most frost-resistant and most intelligent bullet train in the "Fuxing" series departed from Harbin City, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, on Thursday morning for Spring Festival travel rush. Also known as "chunyun," the Spring Festival travel rush, began on January 7 and will last until February 15. Many Chinese people will travel to reunite with their families for the Chinese New Year, which falls on January 22 this year. The company said that there are now two "Fuxing" CR400BF-GZ Electric Multiple Units (EMUs) operating in Heilongjiang ahead of the Spring Festival to enhance transportation capacity. Four more trains of the same model are expected to be operational in the province after Spring Festival. The departure of "Fuxing" CR400BF-GZ EMU from Harbin, where the "Fuxing" bullet trains operate at their highest latitude and in their coldest temperatures, is a notable feat in China's railway technological innovation, said Xu Shoutao, an official of the China Railway Harbin Group Co., Ltd. The train has an automatic anti-freezing function, and its materials and components have been designed to withstand low temperatures, so it can operate normally even in an extremely cold environment of minus 40 degrees Celsius, Xu added. The "Fuxing" EMU was independently designed and manufactured in China and has an operating speed of 350 kilometers per hour.
