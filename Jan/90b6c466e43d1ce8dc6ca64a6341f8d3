American Mikaela Shiffrin became the women's skier with the most World Cup victories by claiming the 83rd win in the giant slalom race in Kronplatz, Italy, on Tuesday. Shiffrin's record-breaking moment came after beating current giant slalom world champion Lara Gut-Behrami by 0.45 seconds, with home hope Federica Brignone completing the podium some 1.43 seconds off the pace. After breaking fellow American Lindsey Vonn's record, Shiffrin is now just three wins away from matching the all-time record set by men's slalom great Ingemar Stenmark. The Swede's 86 World Cup victories came in the 1970s and 1980s. Shiffrin will have a chance to draw one closer to him at Kronplatz on Wednesday with another giant slalom race. "I hope she doesn't get to number 84 straight away because I would like to do something tomorrow," joked Brignone. There are also two races this weekend at Spindleruv Mlyn in the slalom discipline from which 51 of her World Cup wins have come. Shiffrin has bounced back in emphatic style as she failed to win a single medal at the Winter Olympics last year in Beijing. Shiffrin burst onto the international racing scene as an 18-year-old in 2014 when she became the youngest slalom champion in Olympic history. "When people said you're going to break record, you're a 'phenom,' all these words that people used. Every stop of the way I needed not only people to be supportive and help me keep working on my skiing," the 27-year-old said. "But I also needed people to lock my feet on the ground because people tell you you're amazing before you've done anything." (With input from agencies)
