Very few of us have witnessed the polar night, but most of us know about it. The polar night, the opposite of the polar day, occurs when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon for over 24 hours. It is a phenomenon that occurs only inside the polar circle during the winter months. How dark it gets during this period will also depend on how close you are to the poles. Let's follow the Fengyun satellites and enjoy polar nights from space!
