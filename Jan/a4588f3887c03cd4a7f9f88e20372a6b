An exciting horse race was held on Tuesday in a snow-blanketed village of Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. More than 50 riders joined the competition, showcasing their strength and skills along the snowy two-kilometer course. The event was held to entertain local herdsmen and celebrate the Spring Festival, but it was also an effort to attract tourists and boost the local economy.
