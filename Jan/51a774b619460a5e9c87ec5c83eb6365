China's Olympic champion Su Yiming won bronze in the men's snowboard big air event in his Winter X Games debut on Saturday. Compatriot Cai Xuetong took bronze in women's snowboard halfpipe. Su, 18, beautifully landed a left side 1980 run and a right side 1800 run to finish third with a total of 87 points. This was the first time he showcased the 1980 run in a formal competition. Norwegian Marcus Klevelandtook gold with 96 points, and Japan's Takeru Otsuka took silver with 90. Almost a year ago, Su came out on top in the big air event at the Beijing Winter Olympics after finishing second in slopestyle. Eight elite snowboarders are invited to the big air competition in Aspen. Each is given 30 minutes to attempt uncapped number of runs, with the two best scores counted for every rider. Also on Saturday, Chinese veteran Cai who is on her eighth Winter X Games trip, added a bronze to her profile, which already included a silver and two bronze from three editions before Saturday.
