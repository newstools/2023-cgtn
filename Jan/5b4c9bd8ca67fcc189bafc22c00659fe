While domestic travel in China has welcomed a boom, seeing over 300 million trips during the Spring Festival holiday, its outbound tourism is seeing swift recovery as well. Data from Ctrip, one of China's online travel booking websites, showed that its overall orders for outbound travel during the period registered a growth of 640% year-on-year. Newly-released statistics by LY.com, another provider of leisure travel in China, indicate that the number of bookings for outbound airline tickets increased by 258% year-on-year during the holiday, and a growth of 632% for inbound flights, as well as 177% growth for international hotel bookings. On January 20, 2023, China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced that starting February 6, 2023, local travel agencies and online travel operators would resume providing outbound group tours and airline-plus-hotel packages. According to the announcement, the pilot resumption of group travel will be open to 20 destination countries including Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Switzerland and New Zealand. As such, southeast Asian countries have become the most popular outbound destinations. Ctrip’s data shows that flight ticket bookings for Bali have increased by 30 times year-on-year, and a growth of eight times for flight tickets to Singapore. Shen Jiani, a researcher at Ctrip Research Institute, believes that China will see a significant surge of outbound and inbound travel in May as more international flights resume and cross-border travel becomes more convenient.
