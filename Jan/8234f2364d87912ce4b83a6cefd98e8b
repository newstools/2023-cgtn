Seven of the measures focus on providing policy support, easier financing and expanding demand to help MSMEs overcome difficulties. In particular, large enterprises and platform institutions are encouraged to release procurement lists targeting MSMEs and carry out cross-border matchmaking activities, in order to create more business opportunities for MSMEs. The document also outlines eight measures to boost the competitiveness of small businesses. These include enhancing talent cultivation, increasing direct financing support for quality MSMEs and strengthening the application and protection of their intellectual property rights, the document notes.
