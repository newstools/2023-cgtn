The Year of the Rabbit is just around the corner, and there are two "space rabbits" on the moon, the Yutu and the Yutu-2 lunar rovers. What are the stories behind them? Yutu, or the Jade Rabbit, was the first lunar rover designed and built by China independently as part of the country's Change-3 moon mission. It found evidence of at least nine distinct rock layers deep beneath its wheels, indicating that the area has been geologically active over the past 3.3 billion years. The Yutu-2 was first brought to the moon by the Chang'e-4 probe and landed on the far side of the moon on January 3, 2019, making it the first rover to traverse the far side of the moon.
