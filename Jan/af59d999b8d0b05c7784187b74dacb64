Around 600 French soldiers deployed as part of a NATO battle group in Romania held a combat exercise on January 25 to test the 30-nation military alliance's readiness on its eastern flank amid the neighboring Russia-Ukraine conflict. The drill involved some 200 military vehicles, including four French Leclerc battle tanks that practiced firing live ammunition. Romania's defense ministry said the purpose was to practice "the rapid deployment capability and execution of a combat mission."
