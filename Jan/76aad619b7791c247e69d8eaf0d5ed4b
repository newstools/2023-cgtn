Song Tao, head of both the Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, on Saturday met with Hung Hsiu-chu, former chairperson of the Chinese Kuomintang party, in Xiamen City, southeast China's Fujian Province. Song sent Spring Festival wishes and greetings from Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, to Hung, who expressed thanks. The successful convening of the 20th CPC National Congress has made deployment for the current and future work toward Taiwan, which has a significant and far-reaching impact on the development of cross-strait relations and the process of national reunification, Song said. "We will thoroughly implement the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress and respect, care and bring benefits to all Taiwan compatriots," said Song. Song also called for encouraging and supporting more Taiwan compatriots to participate in the process of modernization construction, national rejuvenation and national reunification. For her part, Hung said that Chinese-style modernization is a common modernization for both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and that Taiwan should not and cannot be absent from national rejuvenation. Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits should work together to realize the national rejuvenation and reunification across the Straits, she said.
