"I'm all for the popularization of classical music. Since they need it, I'll do it," Zheng Xiaoying said. As China's first-ever female symphony conductor and the first Chinese musician to conduct at an opera house overseas, 93-year-old Zheng has devoted her life to nourishing people's hearts and souls with music. At the end of 2022, Zheng and her student Wu Lingfen, a combined age of 170, staged the opera "La Traviata". Despite her advanced years, Zheng remains as committed as ever to both performing, and teaching music.
