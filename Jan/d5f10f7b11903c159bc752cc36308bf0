Siddharth Chatterjee, the United Nations' (UN) resident coordinator in China, has extended his New Year greetings to China and expressed his hopes for the Year of the Rabbit. "On behalf of the UN's family in China, I wish all the people of China and their loved ones a very, very happy Chinese New Year,” he said in a video message released on Friday. Noting the rabbit embodies energy, vitality and dexterity, Chatterjee said he had great aspirations for the Year of the Rabbit. "I just find it gives me a sense of hope, as we come out of the long winter of pandemic. I see hope." The official said the cooperation between China and the UN had been a success in the past year, during which the then Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a productive meeting with him and UN Secretary-General António Guterres visited China in February 2022. "We had many, many important achievements and many, many important milestones," he said. Expressing optimism about 2023, Chatterjee noted that UN General Assembly President Csaba Korosi will pay a high-level visit to China, his first official trip to the country, in early February. Chatterjee also highlighted China's contribution to the UN and the world, noting that it is the second highest contributor to the UN budget and UN peacekeeping budget, and critical as a permanent member of UN Security Council. He said the world is facing great challenges including a climate crisis, rising inequality and conflicts in different areas, which need to be resolved. "I see the role of China, as a really important state member of the UN, helping to put an end to these,” he added.
