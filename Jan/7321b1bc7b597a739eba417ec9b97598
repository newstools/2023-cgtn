The plum blossom, which blooms in snowy winter amid severely low temperatures and harsh winds, has become a symbol of resilience in Chinese culture. Chinese poetry features four flowers among the "Four Gentlemen" to praise the highly prized virtues they represent, and the plum blossom tops the list. For thousands of years, numerous poems and paintings have depicted the noble flower. The plum blossom has of course earned a place among the most popular flowers during the Spring Festival. People like to buy fresh branches and add some bright colors to their homes.
