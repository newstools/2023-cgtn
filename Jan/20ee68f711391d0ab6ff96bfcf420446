World's first cruise ship covered by a 5G network will be delivered in China later this year, announced by Adora Cruises, a brand of Chinese cruise ships under CSSC Carnival Cruise Shipping, on Thursday. The company has partnered with China Telecom to bring 5G connectivity to its first China-built large cruise shipÂ and also the world's first 5G cruise ship. The cruise ship will be equipped with advanced wireless communication technology, and a Wi-Fi6 and mobile 5G network will be both available to provide passengers on board with the same network experience as on land. "By seizing a first-mover advantage in the cruise industry's 5G market, we hope to set a new standard for digital communication in the marine travel sector," said Chen Ranfeng, managing director of CSSC Carnival Cruise Shipping, a joint venture between China's largest shipbuilding company China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) and the U.S.-based Carnival Corporation.
