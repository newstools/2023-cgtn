A new plasma operation scenario Super I-Mode was discovered and demonstrated on the Experiment Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST), a big breakthrough announced by Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The team from Institute of Plasma Physics, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, CAS reported their findings in a recent paper published in Science Advances on January 6, 2023. Mastering nuclear fusion, which is an abundant, safe and environmentally competitive energy, is a great challenge for humanity. Tokamak represents one of the most promising paths toward controlled fusion, said the paper. Obtaining a high-performance, steady-state and long-pulse plasma regime remains a critical issue, according to the paper. In the study, a steady-state plasma with a world-record pulse length of 1056 seconds was obtained, where the density and the divertor peak heat flux were well controlled, with no core impurity accumulation, and a new high-confinement and self-organizing regime (Super I-mode = I-mode + e-ITB) was discovered and demonstrated. These achievements contribute to the integration of fusion plasma technology and physics, which is essential to operate next-step devices, said the paper.
