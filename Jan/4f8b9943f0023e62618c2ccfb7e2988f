Icy weather and snow have turned nature reserves in different parts of China into winter wonderlands with stunning landscapes. Rime cloaks the trees and bushes in the Ergun Wetland in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Covering a total area of 1.56 million hectares, the wetland boasts magnificent virgin forests, beautiful natural grasslands and rich biodiversity. With improved ecological conservation, the area's forest coverage has reached 38.2 percent, and the grassland vegetation is 92.6 percent. Huangshan Mountain in east China's Anhui Province, a UNESCO heritage site, has been buried in clouds after days of snowfall. The Huangshan Mountain scenic area is famous for its peculiarly shaped rocks, cloud-shrouded peaks, unique pines and hot springs. Snowfall has also blanketed the grassland of Bashan Mountain in northwest China's Shaanxi Province. Vast swathes of the snow-covered alpine meadow, dotted with dark green pine and cypress trees, present a spectacular sight resembling a Chinese ink wash painting. (Cover image is a screenshot.)
