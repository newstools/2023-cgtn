Efforts to rescue the remaining eight of the Hong Kong-registered vessel's crew which sank in the waters between Japan and South Korea are still ongoing, Japan's coast guard said on Wednesday. The Jin Tian, with 22 crew members on board, sent a distress signal late on Tuesday evening from a position around 110 kilometers (68 miles) west of the remote and uninhabited Danjo islands in far southwestern Japan. Eleven of those rescued so far were "unconscious", the Jeju Coast Guard said earlier. The Japanese coast guard identified the 22 crew members as 14 Chinese and eight Myanmar nationals, as per a Kyodo report.
