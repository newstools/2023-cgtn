Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has unique advantages in the treatment of COVID-19 infections, a TCM expert said on Tuesday. TCM treatment can inhibit the virus, relieving clinical symptoms and preventing cases with mild symptoms from worsening, said Huang Luqi, deputy head of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, at a press conference held by the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism against COVID-19. "For patients who are likely to see severe conditions, the early intervention of TCM can reduce the conversion rate of severe cases," said Huang. "For severe and critical ones, integrated treatment of Chinese and Western medicine can effectively inhibit or alleviate the symptoms to prevent the disease development from becoming more critical or slow the progression, thus reducing the fatality rate." Moreover, the expert mentioned that the proper use of TCM for home-based treatment can relieve the pressure on medical institutions and medical resources, as China has shifted the focus of its COVID-19 response strategy from infection control to case treatment to prevent severe cases. "At present, as influenza, cold and COVID-19 epidemic are intertwined, patients can choose proper TCM for home treatment to reduce the overloading risk and pressure on medical institutions and resources," said Huang. To this end, efforts have been made to roll out guidelines on TCM intervention for COVID-19 patients treated at home, strengthen the building of fever clinics in TCM hospitals, and ensure the supply of key traditional Chinese medicines, Huang said. TCM also played a part in recovery, said Huang, adding that many patients have the personal experience that after their nucleic acid test result turns negative, they still undergo cough, fatigue, sweating and other symptoms. TCM can treat those symptoms and exert its function in overall regulation of the body as a whole. (With input from Xinhua)
