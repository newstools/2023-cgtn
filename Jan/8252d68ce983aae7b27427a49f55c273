A gas explosion tore through a four-story building in the city of Nukus in Uzbekistan on Sunday, killing at least five people, officials said Monday. The emergencies ministry said rescue workers pulled five bodies from the rubble and that an injured five-year-old girl was taken to hospital. The blast was triggered by an "air-gas mixture" in an apartment on the top floor, it added.
