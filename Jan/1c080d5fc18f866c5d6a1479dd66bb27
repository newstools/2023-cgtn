Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday pledged a "strong, swift and precise" response to a deadly Palestinian shooting attack near a synagogue on Jerusalem's outskirts as its military sent more troops into the occupied West Bank. Seven people were killed in Friday's attack, and two others were wounded in another shooting in the city on Saturday. "We are not seeking escalation, but we are prepared for any scenario," Netanyahu said as he convened his security cabinet. He later said the security cabinet decided to increase gun permits for licensed civilians to defend against street attacks. Before the meeting, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he would push for the move. The Jerusalem attack on Friday followed an Israeli raid on Thursday in the West Bank city of Jenin that killed nine Palestinians, including seven gunmen and cross-border fire on Friday between Israel and Gaza. An Israeli military spokesperson said an additional battalion had been sent to the West Bank for reinforcement. However, there was no sign Israel was preparing for a large-scale operation, and its brief cross-border exchange with Gaza ended with no casualties. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is due to arrive for a two-day visit to Israel and the West Bank, where clashes have worsened for months. Thursday's raid was the deadliest in years in the West Bank, where Israel has stepped up operations since a spate of deadly Palestinian street attacks in its cities last year. At least 30 Palestinians – militants and civilians – have been killed in the West Bank since the start of the month. Netanyahu said after the cabinet meeting that he had decided on steps that would be brought forward this week "to strengthen settlements," without elaborating. (With input from Reuters)
