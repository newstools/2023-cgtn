During the 2023 Spring Festival Gala held by China Media Group, an acrobatic show titled "Me and Grandpa Walking on Stilts" impressed global audiences with children showing off their stilt-walking skills, bringing the joyful atmosphere of the Spring Festival to the world.Â Stilts walking, or Cai Gao Qiao in Chinese, is a popular traditional folk performance often seen during the Spring Festival. It can be seen at circuses or parades across China, and has the auspicious meaning of standing tall and having one step up in the new year. Stilts walking has a long history in China and has been listed as a national intangible cultural heritage. It's believed that the practice started with ancient Chinese people using stilts to harvest fruits on trees and for fishing in ponds. The practical use of stilts was later developed into an art form with brightly-colored costumes, make-up, and even acrobatic moves. Stilts walking has since become a popular folk-art form. Many of the stilt walkers are not full-time performers. They practice intensively prior to the Spring Festival and perform during the festivities. For professional performers, more practice time and a higher degree of acrobatic skills are required. These stilts are usually made from wood and are tied tightly to the performers' calves before they stand up. There are various heights to the stilts: the lowest being less than half a meter long, and the highest can reach up to 2.5 meters long. Performers can be seen constantly waving their arms or waving fans to keep balance.
