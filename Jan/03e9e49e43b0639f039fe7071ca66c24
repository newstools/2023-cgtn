The Los Angeles Lakers sent three future second-round draft picks and Kendrick Nunn to the Wizards for Rui Hachimura, who is in the final year of his rookie contract. The three picks are a 2023 second-rounder via the Chicago Bulls, their own pick for 2029 and the less favorable of the Washington Wizards' and Lakers' 2028 second-rounders. On paper, Hachimura is exactly the kind of player the Lakers need with his 2.03-meter-height, 104-kilogram weight, power and 3-point shooting ability. The fact that the Wizards drafted him with the ninth pick in 2019 means he's at least promising. However, landing Hachimura is hardly a game-changer for the Lakers because they have too many problems to fix. They still have assets to make more moves and go after bigger fish on the trade market. Will the purple and gold's movements stimulate more teams to turn some of the trade rumors into real deals? Host: Li Xiang Cover designer: Feng Yuan Chief editor: Chen Ran Supervisor: Zhang Shilei
