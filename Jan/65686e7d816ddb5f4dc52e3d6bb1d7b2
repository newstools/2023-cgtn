United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday extended Chinese New Year greetings to the Chinese people, expressing thanks to China for its strong partnership with the UN and its support for international cooperation. "I'm pleased to send my warmest greetings as we enter the Year of the Rabbit," Guterres said in a video message. "The rabbit is a symbol of energy and agility," he added. "These qualities are what human beings need in times of hardship and trial." The Chinese New Year starts on January 22 this year.
