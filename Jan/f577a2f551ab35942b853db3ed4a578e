"Our Chinese partners define Sino-Russian relations as non-aligned. But in many ways, the relationship between this two countries is more solid than the alliance. Sino-Russian relations uphold the principles of pragmatism, mutual trust, mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, which is exactly the ideal model for establishing relations with any countries,” said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on January 18 while answering a question from CGTN at a press conference on Russia's diplomatic work in 2022. He also pointed out that about half of the trade volume between China and Russia has been settled in RMB and rubles, and this share is growing rapidly and will grow even faster in the future.
