Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced on Tuesday that due to the current circumstances, his country will not host Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military drills on its territory in 2023. "The Armenian Defense Minister has informed the CSTO Joint Staff that in the current situation, we consider it unreasonable to hold CSTO exercises on the territory of Armenia. At least, such exercises will not take place in Armenia this year," Pashinyan was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
