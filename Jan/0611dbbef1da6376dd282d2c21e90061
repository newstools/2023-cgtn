With the improvement of China's overall COVID-19 epidemic situation and the accelerated restoration of the normal order of production and living, the vitality and potential of China's economic society will be fully released to inject more confidence and power into the promotion of global economic recovery, Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remarks in response to a question regarding international professional organizations being generally optimistic about China's economy, at a press briefing. Wang said recently, more international professional organizations believe China's optimized COVID-19 prevention and control measures will bring major benefits to global economic recovery. World Economic Forum (WEF) President Borge Brende recently said China's optimization of COVID-19 response will further contribute to global economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says China's economy will grow steadily in 2023, and become the biggest positive factor of global economy. Financial institutions including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, British bank Barclays and French investment bank Natixis raised China's economic growth expectation in 2023. The Chinese government actively optimized and adjusted the COVID-19 prevention and control measures in light of the situation, which is the right move for the effective planning of epidemic prevention and control and the development of society, Wang said.
