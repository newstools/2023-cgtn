Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was briefly detained by police on January 17 at a protest over the expansion of a western Germany coal mine. In the clash with police, Thunberg and several protesters ran over to an open-pit mine,Â which has a sharp break-off. Thunberg was carried away by police from the edge of the mine and detained. She was released shortly after.
