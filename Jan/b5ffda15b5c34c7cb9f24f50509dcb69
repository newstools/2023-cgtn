The total number of registered survivors of the Nanjing Massacre has fallen to 48 as six survivors have passed away since December 24, according to the Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders. Of the six survivors, Guo Linda died at the age of 93 on Friday. The average age of the survivors is over 90, making them a key group to focus on amid the COVID-19 outbreaks in China, according to the Aid Association of Victims in Nanjing during the War of Aggression against China by Japanese Invaders. Recently, the association staff has paid close attention to the health conditions of each survivor, and local medics in Nanjing, the capital city of east China's Jiangsu Province, have designed emergency treatment plans for them. The municipal government of Nanjing also provided supplies including medicines, blood oxygen detection apparatuses and facial masks for survivors, and planned express channels for the elderly to access their doctors. The Nanjing Massacre took place when Japanese troops captured Nanjing City on December 13, 1937. Over six weeks, they killed approximately 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers in one of the most barbaric episodes of World War II. In 2014, China's top legislature designated December 13 as the national memorial day for the victims of the Nanjing Massacre. In a separate development , January 8th marks the 31st anniversary of the weekly Wednesday Demonstration for the Resolution of the Japanese Military Sexual Slavery Issue for "comfort women" victims. On this day 31 years ago, the Korean Council organized its first "Wednesday Demonstration," a protest amplifying the voices of "comfort women," in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul.
