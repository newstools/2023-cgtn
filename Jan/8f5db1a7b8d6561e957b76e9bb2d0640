Wildlife authorities last weekÂ released a video of over 100 blossom-headed parakeets perching on tree branches in Ruili City, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, southwest China's Yunnan Province, highlighting a significant boom in the birds' population in China.The blossom-headed parakeet is an endangered bird under China's second-class state protection. In the past, the bird was distributed in south China's Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Over the past 20 years, just a small number of them, fewer than 10 at any one time, had previously been seen sporadically only in Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture.The recent record-setting number proves that the population of blossom-headed parakeets in China is recovering, said Liu Yang, an ornithologist and professor at Sun Yat-sen University School of Life Science in Guangdong.Moreover, many precious parakeets, such as Alexandrine parakeets, grey-headed parakeets, red-breasted parakeets and rose-ringed parakeets, have also been observed in Ruili, setting a new record of parakeet species in a single area in China.Liu said that China is home to nine species of parakeets and over half of them have been recorded in such a small area, which is indeed rare.
