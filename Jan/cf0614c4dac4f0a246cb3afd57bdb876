Novak Djokovic of Serbia reached the Australian Open men's singles final over American Tommy Paul on Friday, looking to lift his 10th trophy in Melbourne in Sunday's final. The 21-time Grand Slam winner survived Paul's challenge in the first set when the American leveled it 5-5 after trailing 0-3. The Serb took the first set after breaking Paul in the 12th game. Djokovic showed dominance in the second set, breaking 35th-ranked Paul twice to take the lead at 5-0. Paul managed to hold the serves in the sixth game, but the set easily went to Djokovic 6-1 shortly after. Djokovic then stormed to victory with a 6-2 win in the third over Paul, who concluded his first Grand Slam semifinal. In the other semifinal earlier, Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece first booked a place in the final over Karen Khachanov from Russia 7-6 (7-2), 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3. This would be the No.3 seed's debut in the final at Australian Open, having failed thrice before. Tsitsipas and Djokovic will meet in the final on Sunday. (With input from agencies)
