World No. 1 Novak Djokovic of Serbia reached the Dubai Tennis Championship semifinal with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Hubert Hurkacz of Poland on Thursday. He will next face Russia's Daniil Medvedev, who downed Borna Coric of Croatia 6-3, 6-2 later the same day. Djkovic came to his 378th week as world No.1 on Monday, a new record for both male and female players, surpassing the previous record of 377 set by Germany's Steffi Graf. He is also on course for his third title of 2023 after winning the Adelaide International and Australian Open in January. Having breezed through the first set on the back of a single break, Djokovic found the going a bit tougher in the next as Hurkacz raised his game in search of a first win in their fifth meeting. After a crucial hold from 0-30 down to draw level at 5-5, Djokovic grabbed another break to pressure Hurkacz and closed out the match on serve. With former world No.1 Medvedev, Djokovic leads the pair's head-to-head series 9-4. The other semifinal will be between Alexander Zverev of Germany and Andrey Rublev of Russia.
