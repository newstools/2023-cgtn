Deputies to the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) gathered Saturday morning at a preparatory meeting to elect the presidium and set the agenda for the first session of the 14th NPC, which is scheduled on Sunday. A 192-member presidium was elected, with Li Hongzhong as secretary-general of the NPC session, according to a statement issued after the meeting. "All preparation for the annual session is done," said Chairman of the 13th NPC Standing Committee Li Zhanshu, who presided over the preparatory meeting. The meeting also adopted the nine-item agenda of the session. The newly-elected presidium met shortly afterwards and elected Zhao Leji and 10 other deputies to the 14th NPC as executive chairpersons of the presidium. Li Zhanshu shook hands with all executive chairpersons before heading out the meeting hall, amid warm applause. Attendees to the presidium meeting then decided on the schedule of the NPC session, among other matters. The NPC will be in session from March 5 to 13 this year. Later on Saturday afternoon, the first meeting of executive chairpersons of the presidium was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, presided over by Zhao Leji. Earlier Saturday morning before the preparatory meeting, chairman and vice chairpersons of the 13th NPC Standing Committee concluded a meeting to make preparations for the upcoming session. The meeting, presided over by Li Zhanshu, finalized a list of candidates for the presidium and secretary-general of the first session of the 14th NPC and heard a report on the session's draft agenda, which were later submitted to the preparatory meeting.
