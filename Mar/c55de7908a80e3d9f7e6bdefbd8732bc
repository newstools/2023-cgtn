An object that was seen streaking across the sky in January has been confirmed as a comet by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center (MPC). The comet was first discovered on January 9 by astronomers using the near-earth-object-telescopic-finder at the Xuyi Observation Station in east China's Jiangsu Province. The station belongs to the Purple Mountain Observatory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The discovery was confirmed by the MPC on Wednesday and was named Tsuchinshan-ATLAS. The comet is making its way toward the sun and its brightness will increase rapidly. It is expected to be visible to the naked eye in September 2024, according to the astronomical observatory.
