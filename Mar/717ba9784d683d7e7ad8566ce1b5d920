China is not Africa's largest creditor, a spokesperson for China's National People's Congress (NPC) said on Saturday, noting that data from the World Bank shows that nearly three-quarters of Africa's external debt comes from multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors. China has always been committed to helping African countries ease their debt burden, Wang Chao, spokesperson for the first session of the 14th NPC, said at a press conference, refuting the claim that China is creating "debt traps" in Africa under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China has been actively engaged in the Group of 20 (G20) Debt Service Suspension Initiative and case-by-case debt treatment, Wang said, adding that the country has suspended the most debt service payments among G20 members. In carrying out BRI cooperation, China never attaches any political strings or seeks any selfish political gains, he said. The BRI, proposed by China in 2013, has become a highly popular global public good and cooperation platform, Wang said. The spokesperson added that over 150 countries and more than 30 international organizations have signed BRI cooperation documents in the past decade, and the initiative has made contributions in regard to the economy, employment and livelihoods of countries concerned. China will join hands with all partners to make new progress in high-quality BRI cooperation and provide legal safeguards, Wang added.
