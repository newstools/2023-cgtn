Olympic gold medalist Zhang Yufei in women's 200m butterfly at Tokyo 2020 now has a new title: deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature. When asked about how she will balance her new role and her position as an aspiring swimmer, Zhang said she will always put her swimming career first. "However many new roles I get, my main job is still the most important," she told CGTN. The 24-year-old said she has prepared a lot for the upcoming gathering, including a proposal on the improvement of teenagers' physical education. "I hope to use my experience to help them and provide a solid foundation for China's keystone education," she said. As a representative of the youth, Zhang hopes she can make the voices of the younger generation heard by society. Speaking of her ultimate goal in swimming, she shared her "grand targets" that even "scare" herself from time to time. "The first is that I hope I can defend my 200m butterfly title. Then I hope that Team China can win gold in the short-course butterfly, as we haven't won any golds as of today. Next is that I hope I can be a role model for Chinese swimmers that future generations will remember." Check out Zhang's story.
