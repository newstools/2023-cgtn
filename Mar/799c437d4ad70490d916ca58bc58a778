China has registered the property rights of key natural resource assets for better protection of ecological environment.The first batch of registered natural resource assets include Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park in south China's Hainan Province, Dafeng National Nature Reserve for Elk in east China's Jiangsu Province and Kunyu Mountain National Nature Reserve in east China's Shandong Province.The property rights system for natural resource assets will clarify the responsibility of the rights holders and improve the efficiency for the protection and development of natural resources.Officials said China has been improving the legal system for property rights over natural resource assets in recent years. It will register the property rights for more natural resource assets including waters, mountains, grasslands, uninhabited islands and mineral resources."By registering natural resources, we will clearly define the property rights holders of various natural resource assets in the registration unit. We will draw a clear boundary between the ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, between the ownership by the whole people and the ownership by different levels of governments, between different collective owners, and between different types of natural resources," said Tian Wenbiao, director of Natural Resources Registration Bureau of Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources."The property rights system will provide basis for effective supervision and strict protection of natural resources and the exercise of owner's rights and interests," Tian said.
