U.S. President Joe Biden declared an official emergency in California on Friday morning due to powerful winter storms, allowing federal coordination of relief efforts in more than 30 counties. Over 9,000 California residents were under evacuation orders on Friday, as more heavy rain and strong winds swelled rivers and flooded several major highways.
