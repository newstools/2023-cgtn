Home of Tujia ethnic group in Fenghuang Ancient Town Named after a mythological bird, Fenghuang Ancient Town is a fantastically preserved ancient town with a rich history dating back to the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty in 1704. The Tujia stilted building cluster, situated in the southeastern part of the town, is an excellent spot to experience the culture and customs of this ethnic group. Overlooking the Tuojiang River and facing an ancient road, this cluster ranks among the most impressive architectural wonders of Fenghuang Ancient Town. It features prominent Miao architectural characteristics and was built in a distinct local style with two levels, each supported by wooden structures. The upper level is spacious and well-crafted, with intricately carved roof eaves, railings, and windows. The lower level is not used as a formal living space, but the stilted portion is exquisitely carved with patterns. Both levels are connected by cantilevered corridors or rooms suspended above the river, creating some unique and stunning scenery. This type of architecture features unique ventilation, moisture prevention, and insulation techniques used by the Miao people for both cooling in summer and staying warm in winter.
