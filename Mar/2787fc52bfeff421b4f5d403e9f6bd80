Barcelona frustrated Real Madrid with a 1-0 win in the Copa del Rey semifinal first leg on Thursday. Barca earned a much-needed win after arriving in the Spanish capital under pressure, after being knocked out of the Europa League and losing at lowly Almeria to halt a seven-game winning streak in La Liga. Real Madrid started the game better, but Barcelona began to turn things around as they took control the midfield and put up good defense. The visitors kept up their defense after Real center back Eder Militao scored an own goal in the 26th minute, and managed to win despite losing key players including Robert Lewandowski, Pedri and Ousmane Dembele to injuries beforehand. They meet again in Barcelona in April with the winners set to face Athletic Bilbao or Osasuna in the final. (With input from Reuters)
