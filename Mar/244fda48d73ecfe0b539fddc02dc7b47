Chinese Commerce Ministry on Wednesday said that China is open to U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's visit to China. The ministry said in a statement that it has learned about media reports that Raimondo was considering a China trip this year. But the ministry has not received any information from the U.S. side, according to the statement. "We believe that it is very important for the commerce departments of the two sides to maintain dialogue and communication," it added. "China will continue to be committed to addressing each other's concerns through dialogue and promoting constructive and practical cooperation."
