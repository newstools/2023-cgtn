Left tackle Duane Brown of the New York Jets will come back and play the 17th NFL season of his career in 2023, his agent Kennard McGuire told ESPN on Sunday. Brown, 37, underwent a surgery to repair a torn left rotator cuff recently. He suffered that injury in training camp before the 2022 season begun. It cost him four games, but Brown postponed the surgery until after the campaign, during which he started 12 games. Having been impressed by Brown's toughness, the Jets created the "Selfless Warrior" award and made him the first recipient of it. "Duane is a freaking rock star, man, the way he fought through pain and injury," the Jets' head coach Robert Saleh said last week. "He did what I'd say about 90 percent of players probably wouldn't have done, in terms of playing when he didn't have to. All his money was already guaranteed, and the guy still strapped up and played 16 or however many games for us. ... So a lot of respect for him, love his grind, love his grit, love what he stands for, and if he's here, it'd be awesome." As a five-time Pro-Bowler free agent, Brown joined the Jets on a two-year, $20 million contract in August 2022. His base salary for the 2023 season will be $9 million. The team also has Mekhi Becton and Max Mitchell for the left tackle position. The Jets have one pick for each round in the NFL Draft in April and may use some of them to enhance their depth in the position. The Jets finished the 2022 regular season with a 7-10 record and failed to make the playoffs for the 12th year in a row.
