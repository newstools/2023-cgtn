Though the chasm in quality between the two teams was obvious from the first minute, and did not abate for the next hour and a half, China's resilient display earned them a 1-1 draw against Kyrgyzstan in a Group D match of the ongoing AFC U20 Asian Cup in Tashkent on Thursday night. The draw ensured China's place in the quarterfinals of the tournament for the first time in nine years.With its attack a paragon of brisk, intelligent movement, Kyrgyzstan looked sharper in the opening stages. China, however, took the lead against the run of play in the 58th minute when captain Aifeierding Aisikaer's attempted pass to Baihelamu Abuduwaili was deflected into his own net by Kyrgyzstan's Mirlan Bekberdinov. For a brief moment, it seemed as if the tie would be remembered for this freak own goal despite a barrage of attacks from Kyrgyzstan, but their dominance finally told when Biimyrza Zhenishbekov unleashed a fiery shot beyond the reach of goalkeeper Li Hao with three minutes remaining. Overwhelmed by Kyrgyzstan's assault, China rode their luck and never got into their stride. Kyrgyzstan could have made it a more comfortable night had the team converted some of the good chances they created early on. Eventually, China's defensive solidity and formidable teamwork, as well as a bit of good fortune, saw them hold on to a precious point. The hard-fought draw means China clinched second place in Group D behind Japan, whose 2-1 win over defending champions Saudi Arabia sent the Chinese into the knockout stage at the expense of the title holders.  "We haven't reached the last eight of this tournament for nearly 10 years. I hope our qualification this time will give Chinese people a bit of joy," said a delighted Aifeierding during the pitch-side interview after the game. For all the jubilation, China will need to perform substantially better than they did on Thursday night if they are to get beyond South Korea, their quarterfinal opponents, in three days' time.
