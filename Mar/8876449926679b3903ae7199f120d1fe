Barcelona currently enjoy a seven-point lead over Real Madrid in La Liga after both sides played 23 games. Judging by history, it won't be easy for the team behind to catch up. First, the rest of the league is hardly able to slow Barca down, especially after they have no European competitions to worry about; second, Real's biggest target this season is likely the UEFA Champions League title. By contrast, the race for the Serie A championship seems over since Napoli's 18-point lead is unshakable. The team has been so dominant that they have won 21 of their 24 games in the domestic league so far. It's only a matter of time for Gli Azzurri (The Blues) to add a third Serie A title trophy to their room of honors.
