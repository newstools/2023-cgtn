Emergency room doctor, Xu Xiaochan, went to an impoverished mountainous village in July 2019. When she arrived, there was no doctor, nor was there a proper clinic. "There are maybe some households living on top of one hill and some living on another. Plus, the mountain roads are not easy to travel along back and forth, which creates significant challenges for medical treatment," she told CGTN. Xu was elected a deputy to the 14th National People's Congress, China's top legislature, this year. She hopes she could give more suggestions on rural medical care at the gathering based on her years of hands-on experience. Here's Xu's story.
