At least two people have died and 28 are missing after a small ferry foundered off the Gabonese coast, a port official told AFP on Thursday. The ferry, on an overnight trip from the capital Libreville to the city of Port-Gentil, reported "water intrusion" between 3:00 a.m. (0200 GMT) and 4:00 a.m. and lost control, the vessel's owner, Royal Cost Marine, said on Facebook. Emergency teams are at the site and "the passengers are currently being rescued," it said.
