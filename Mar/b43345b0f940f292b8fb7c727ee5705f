Sevim Dagdelen, member of the German Bundestag, has labeled the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines a terrorist attack, adding that the German government is obligated to look into the case and find the culprit. Dagdelen made the remarks during a recent interview with China Media Group (CMG). She believes that both the Nord Stream pipeline blast and the Russia-Ukraine conflict resulted from U.S. hegemony, and the EU is the biggest victim.
