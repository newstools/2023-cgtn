With its steady supply of weapons and ammunition from the West, Ukraine has been able to mount a formidable defense against Russia through the past year of conflict. Under growing pressure, Poland has become the first country to deliver Leopard tanks to Ukraine on the first anniversary of the conflict. However, it is reported that across Europe and even in the United States, ammunition is coming in short supply. How sustainable is the military supply chain to Ukraine? Is the commitment strong enough that the U.S. and Europe will continue to support Ukraine until victory? In this Dialogue Special, Ukraine Crisis One Year On, the guests are William Courtney, an adjunct senior fellow at the Rand Corporation and former U.S. ambassador to Georgia and Kazakhstan, and also Andrew Korybko, Moscow-based American political analyst.
