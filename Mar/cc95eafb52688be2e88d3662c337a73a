China is committed to promoting the building of a community with a shared future for humanity, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Monday. China's development benefits the world and China cannot develop in isolation from the rest of the world, Xi said when addressing the closing meeting of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature. China will work to advance high-standard opening-up, Xi said, adding that it will not only leverage global markets and resources for its own development, but also promote the development of the whole world. "We will be dedicated to peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit, stand firmly on the right side of history, practice true multilateralism, and uphold the shared values of humanity," Xi said. Noting that China will play an active part in the reform and development of the global governance system, Xi said China will advance the implementation of the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative. He pledged that China is ready to work with the international community to put these two initiatives into action. (Cover: The UN headquarters in New York, U.S., October 14, 2019. /Xinhua)
