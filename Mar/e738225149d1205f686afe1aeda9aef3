Construction worker Zou Bin, 27, has just been re-elected as a deputy to China's National People's Congress. Coming from a small village in central China's Hunan Province, he said his original aspiration remains the same after five years as a lawmaker. "I will still speak on behalf of the construction industry, the construction workers and those skilled workers, and make their voices heard," he told CGTN. When asked how he stood out from millions of migrant workers and came to the center stage, Zou said his life changed drastically after entering a world-level construction skill competition. "I would never have imagined moving to Changsha before I got into the competition," he said, thankful for the opportunity offered by a contractor he knew when he was 18. "My mentality back then was more like 'learn a skill, make some money, go back home and get married. Or open a small market or store'." Here's Zou's story.
