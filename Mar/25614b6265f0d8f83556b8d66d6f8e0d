Denmark's government on Thursday reshuffled its cabinet in the wake of Defense Minister Jakob Elleman-Jensen's continued illness, making deputy Liberal Party leader Stephanie Lose the new minister in charge of the economy. Troels Lund Poulsen, who has been minister of economics since the government was formed in December, will continue his role as acting minister of defense until Elleman-Jensen returns to the office, the prime minister's office said in a statement.
