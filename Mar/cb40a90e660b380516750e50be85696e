Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang on Thursday refuted allegations that Chinese embassies and consulates in Canada were trying to interfere in Canadian elections. He made the remarks when meeting with his Canadian counterpart Melanie Joly on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in New Delhi, India. Qin said that claims of "interference" in Canadian elections were completely false and nonsensical, which China firmly opposes. He stressed that China has never interfered in the internal affairs of other countries, and opposes any interference by any country in the internal affairs of other countries. Chinese embassies and consulates in Canada have been adhering to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and are committed to promoting China-Canadian relationship and bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various fields, he added. He urged the Canadian side to take practical measures to ensure that Chinese diplomatic missions in Canada perform their duties normally and do not allow rumors and speculation to disturb relations between the two countries.
