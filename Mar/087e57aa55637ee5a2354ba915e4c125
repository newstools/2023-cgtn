Lilith Liu is a young up-and-coming jazz vocalist who has a gift for spicing up jazz works through her love of musicals. Her performances are always dynamic and she moves around on stage with dramatic and emotional intent. "I like to surprise the audience. It is a professional jazz club, where people normally just perform on stage. When I’m singing, the audience often wonders where I am, and then suddenly I show up!" Lilith Liu graduated from the renowned Tianjin Conservatory of Music and pursued her studies in musical theater performance in the U.S.A., giving her the chance to perform at jazz clubs worldwide ever since. In 2017, Liu was invited to perform at the Chinese premiere and press conference for the Oscar-winning movie "La La Land" by its music department. "I sang the song 'City of Stars' before the premiere, and there was one picture of Ryan Gosling and Damien Chazelle peeking out from behind a door to find out what was going on," Liu recalled, admitting to feeling quite excited at the time. "I would say this movie opened the gate to jazz for Chinese audiences." As one of the youngest Chinese jazz divas, she has collaborated with musicians from New York, Shanghai and Beijing. Not only active on stage, Liu also shares videos of herself singing at home, which attract a large following online. Through her social media influence, she aims to introduce jazz to more Chinese music lovers in this new way: "In the future, besides my personal music plans, there will be social media projects with some of my musician friends. We want to make jazz easier to understand by rearranging Chinese songs," she said.
