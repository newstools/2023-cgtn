China has successfully carried out its first ignition experiment in space at the China Space Station, following the order sent from the ground team, according to the Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization under the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS). The ignition experiment comprised two ignitions and used methane as fuel; the fire lasted 30 seconds. It is the first ignition test inside a Chinese spacecraft in orbit. Experts said the shape of the flame in space appears shorter and rounder in a microgravity environment compared to that on the ground. The combustion science experiment system at the space station verified the functions of the whole process, setting up a foundation for the following combustion experiments in space. The development of the experiment system was led by the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics under CAS. There are 10 research plans for the combustion science experiment in the microgravity environment, comprising 79 experiment subjects in total. Over 40 combustion experiments are expected to be completed in space by the end of this year to create the country's first batch of data in the field. The following cargo craft, Tianzhou-6, will send more diverse materials for the combustion experiments, which will be carried out inside and outside the station.
