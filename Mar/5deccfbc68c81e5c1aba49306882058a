China and Japan should learn lessons from history to foster a better relationship in the new era, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Tuesday. He made the remarks at a press conference held on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress in Beijing. Noting the harm Japanese soldiers inflicted on the Chinese people during World War II, Qin said the Chinese people will not forget this and neither should the Japanese. Should some people from the Japanese side choose the beggar-thy-neighbor approach rather than pursuing a friendly partnership, and take part in a new cold war to contain China, the bilateral relations would only suffer new wounds when the old ones are yet to be healed, he said. As this year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Qin said the treaty and other political papers make up the political foundation for the China-Japan relationship, especially the pledge that the two countries pose no threat and are cooperative partners to each other. He stressed that the important political consensus should be strictly observed. Qin also said China urges Japan to properly handle the disposal of Fukushima nuclear wastewater in a responsible manner. (With input from Xinhua)
