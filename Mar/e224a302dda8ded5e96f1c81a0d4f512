Chinese commercial banks have issued 14.6 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) worth of green bonds, reported Securities Daily, quoting data from financial services data provider Wind. The bonds were issued by five Chinese commercial banks. In recent years, China has seen continued attempts by its Chinese commercial banks to develop the green finance industry. Notably, urban and rural commercial banks have become a major force of green bond issuance. Of the five commercial banks that have issued green bonds so far this year, three of them were urban and rural commercial banks, totaling 3.6 billion yuan worth in bond issuances. The largest green bond issuer among the three is the Bank of Guiyang, headquartered in Guiyang, Guizhou Province, which alone issued green bonds worth 3 billion yuan.
