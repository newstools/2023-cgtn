The prevention of major accidents is of primary importance, said Wang Xiangxi, Chinese minister of emergency management, on Tuesday. Speaking at the "Ministers' Corridor" after the second plenary meeting of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC), Wang noted the prevention measures to safeguard industries and people's safety, and highlighted the achievements made by the minister of emergency management since the new ministry established in 2019. According to Wang, to prevent major accidents, the first is to hold people in responsibility and the second is to conduct special rectification actions in major sectors. Thirdly, experts need to help high-risk industries, like the mining industry, eliminate security risks and solve security problems. Fourthly, advanced equipment ought to be employed in high-risk industries to replace workers, and workers should receive more training to improve safety knowledge. Since the minister of emergency management restructured, the number of death in safety production accidents and natural disasters has decreased year by year. The unified arrangement of all kinds of accidents and disasters, the active prevention and the efficient coordination of various rescue forces all contribute to the achievements. (Cover image via CFP)
