Central Street, also known as Zhong Yang Street, is a bustling commercial pedestrian street in Harbin, Heilongjiang. Recently, it has seen a significant increase in tourism. Located in Daoli District, Central Street stretches 1,400 meters from the Flood Control Memorial Tower Square to Xinyang Square in the south. This long street was first built in 1900 and features 71 old buildings in various architectural styles, such as Renaissance and Baroque. Central Street is where the Western influence on Harbin can be most easily spotted. Its formation can be traced back to 1898 when Harbin began building large-scale railways and other urban infrastructure projects. As carts carrying railway equipment made their way through the muddy terrain, a road was formed where Chinese residents had settled, resulting in it picking up the moniker Chinese Street at that time. The most distinctive feature of Central Street is that it is entirely covered with rectangular stones. In May 1924, Central Street was paved with these based on the design of a Russian engineer. Each stone is 18cm long and 10cm wide. The shape and size of the stones are said to resemble that of Russian bread, while their cobbled surface makes for a rare sight in China. Central Street is a microcosm of Harbin's unique architectural culture and European-style living. As a famous local saying goes, "If you haven't been to Central Street, you haven't been to Harbin." It serves as a perennial attraction for tourists from all over the world, offering many enticing hotspots to explore. Other popular choices for visitors include: enjoying an authentic Russian meal; trying some local smoked pork sausage, or hong chang; strolling around and feeding the pigeons; and sampling the local ice cream and popsicles. No entry ticket is needed for those who wish to explore Central Street. It can be visited at any time of day, all year round, but most of the shops and restaurants close at about 10:30 pm.
