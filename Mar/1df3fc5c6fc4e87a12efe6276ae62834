At least 17 people were killed and more than 100 injured when an explosion struck an office building in Bangladeshi capital's commercial district on Tuesday, authorities said. The blast shook the lower floors of a seven-story building in Gulistan, a major hub for wholesale goods in Dhaka, shortly before 5 p.m. local time. Several floors of the building and the side walls were destroyed in the explosion, which sent rubble and splinters flying into crowded streets.
