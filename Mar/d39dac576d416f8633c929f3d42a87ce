Panthera, a wild cat conservation organization, released a rare video of three West African lion cubs. The cubs, who could be the future kings of savannah, were spotted in February by remote cameras in the Niokolo-Koba National Park in southeastern Senegal. Florence, the lioness caught on camera, is thought to be 9 or 10 years old. The three cubs, two males and a female, are believed to be her third litter since 2021. Listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, the West African lion is threatened by poaching and illegal trading. Panthera has been working with Senegal's Department of National Parks on conservation since 2011. The organization believes that the footage is a documentation of new life, which indicates the remarkable recovery of a population on the brink of extinction. (With input from AFP.
