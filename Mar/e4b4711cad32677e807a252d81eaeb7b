The SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft Endeavour carrying four NASA astronauts arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) early Friday morning. The Dragon spacecraft Endurance was launched on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Thursday. The spacecraft docked to the ISS at 1:40 a.m. Eastern Time (0640 GMT) Friday. Before docking, ground controllers troubleshooted a software issue on the spacecraft. The mission, codenamed Crew-6, is the sixth crew rotation flight of a Dragon spacecraft as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The mission carries NASA astronauts Stephen Bowen and Warren "Woody" Hoburg, as well as United Arab Emirates astronaut Sultan Alneyadi and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev to the space station for a science expedition mission. The Crew-6 will carry out over 200 experiments including studies of how particular materials burn in microgravity, tissue chip research on heart, brain and cartilage functions, and an investigation that will collect microbial samples from the outside of the space station, according to NASA. Some of the research will help pave the way for future long-duration human expeditions to the moon and beyond under NASA's Artemis program, its successor to Apollo, the U.S. space agency said. The ISS crew also is responsible for performing maintenance and repairs aboard the station, and to prepare for the arrival and departure of other astronauts and cargo payloads.
