The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday lifted mandatory COVID-19 test requirements for travelers from China. The decision took effect for flights departing to the United States from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and designated airports at or after 3 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday, according to an announcement on the CDC website. It means that air passengers no longer need to get tested and show a negative COVID-19 test result, or show documentation of recovery from COVID-19, prior to boarding a flight to the United States from those places, according to the CDC. Designated airports include Incheon International Airport in Seoul of the Republic of Korea, Toronto Pearson International Airport in Canada and Vancouver International Airport in Canada, according to the CDC.
