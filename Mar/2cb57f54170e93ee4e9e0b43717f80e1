Young Chinese people have an important role to play to make China's voice heard loud and clear on the world stage, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Tuesday at a press conference held on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress in Beijing. Qin said young people should be confident, enterprising and open-minded. He said he hopes the young people will have dialogue with the world on an equal footing to share their unique perspectives, and tell the world who they are. "Young people need to cultivate a global vision and draw on others' strengths through exchange and mutual learning," Qin added. (Cover image via CFP)
