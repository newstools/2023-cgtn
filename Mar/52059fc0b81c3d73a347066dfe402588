China's national political advisors believe that the country's economy remains resilient and is full of potential and vigor, a spokesperson for the first session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) said Friday. Spokesperson Guo Weimin said China's economy remained stable as the country has overcome the impact of unexpected factors such as complex international situations, the pandemic and natural disasters. The nation shows great resilience and potential as it has a solid foundation in terms of market size, industry development and human resources, Guo said. Guo added China's economic development needs to put "stable growth on top priority" in 2023, Â achieving "effective improvement in quality and reasonable growth in quantity." "The national political advisors have suggested taking concrete reform moves to improve expectations and boost confidence," he told reporters. Citing advice from the CPPCC National Committee members, Guo said the country should continue to implement a strategy to expand domestic demand to accelerate recovery and spur consumption. Efforts should be made to promote stable and healthy development of the property sector and advance the industry's transformation to a new development model, he noted. He also suggested stronger policy guidance to facilitate digital transformation of traditional industries and small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as deepened reforms to allow financial institutions to better serve small and micro-sized businesses and innovation.
