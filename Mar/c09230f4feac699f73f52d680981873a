Iran on Monday expressed its readiness for a long-awaited prisoner swap with Belgium, days after the European country's Constitutional Court gave the green light for such a move. Following the decision "by the Belgian Constitutional Court, we can now say that the way to implement the agreement has been opened, and the Islamic republic of Iran certainly welcomes this change," Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanani told reporters in Tehran.
