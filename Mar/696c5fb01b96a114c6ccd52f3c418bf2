U.S. stocks slumped Monday with key indices markedly lower amid worries over the banking system, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and shuttering of Signature Bank. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7 percent while the broad-based S&P 500 lost more than 1 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.9 percent, while regional banks remained under pressure as well.
