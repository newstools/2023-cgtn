The Japanese government said in January that the controversial plan to release radioactive wastewater into the Pacific would start in spring or summer, despite strong opposition from Pacific leaders and requests for a delay from countries concerned. Ang Teck Sin, a political commentator in Singapore, said in an interview with China Media Group (CMG) that Japan's plan is a terrible disaster for the marine environment and the Earth's ecology. He said it is also a flagrant violation of international law and that Japan should stop this illegal practice immediately.
