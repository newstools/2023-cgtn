Among the spring blossoms, the Yulan Magnolia could be one of the most anticipated for its elegant beauty and sweet citrus-lemon fragrance. As it is one of the plants to feel the first warmth of spring, it is dubbed "an envoy of spring" by Chinese. Yulan Magnolia is native to central and eastern China. During the blossoming period, the buds gradually spread on naked branches, and soon you can expect to see a whole tree of flowers. It has been regarded as a symbol of purity by Buddhist monks in China since the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Emperors including Kangxi and Qianlong also showed love to Yulan Magnolia and even planted it at the palace. Many Chinese cities have dubbed Yulan Magnolia as the "Flower of the City", including Lianyungang, Shanghai and Dongguan. It can endure cold and has many cultivars which produce flowers in yellow and pink, instead of the original white.
