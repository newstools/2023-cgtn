According to data from the General Administration of Customs, the number of breeding pigs imported from abroad to China was only about 3,700 as of November 2022, which is roughly 15 percent of the total amount imported in 2021. National People's Congress Deputy Qin Yinglin, chairman of China's largest pig breeding company Muyuan Food Stuff, said there's still a gap between the domestic standard of breeding pigs and the international advanced standards. He called for promoting smart farming to ensure food security.
