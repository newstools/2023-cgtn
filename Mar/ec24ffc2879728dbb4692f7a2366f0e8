Johnny Ng, a lawmaker from China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said he hopes to see more integration in the Greater Bay Area, especially among the youth. Â The area comprises nine cities in south China's Guangdong Province along with the HKSAR and Macao SAR. "(The area) can provide a better platform and more space for young people in the region, not only in Hong Kong but also I think in the mainland," he told CGTN in an interview on Sunday.
