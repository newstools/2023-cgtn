One year after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the world is becoming more and more polarized. Western countries such as the United States and those in the European Union have chosen to isolate Russia while large developing countries like India, Brazil and China have opted to stay neutral. What is the rationale for both views? Will the Ukraine crisis define a new world order? And how are different countries showing unity in their views of the crisis? In this Dialogue Special, Ukraine Crisis: One Year On, the guests are Pepe Escobar, a Brazilian Eurasia-wide geopolitical analyst and author, and Fraser Cameron, senior advisor from the European policy centre in Brussels.
