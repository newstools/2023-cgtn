China will take concrete measures to promote opening-up and continue to provide new opportunities and drivers for global development, said Guo Weimin, spokesperson for the first session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on Friday. Over the years, the country has taken various measures such as easing of market access and establishment of pilot free trade zones. A shortened negative list for foreign investment went into effect in 2022, cutting the number of items that were off limits to 31. The total number of pilot free trade zones has reached 21, with building China's island province of Hainan into a globally influential and high-level free trade port (FTP). By January 1, 2023, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP) had entered into force for one year. China has also actively applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). As one of the major events related to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) proposed by China,Â the China International Import Expo (CIIE) has been held for five consecutive years despite the COVID-19 epidemic. According to the Ministry of Commerce, China's foreign trade hit record highs again in 2022, topping $6.56 trillion, while the actual use of foreign direct investment (FDI) reached $18.91 billion. Guo said that the CPPCC National Committee has actively contributed to opening-up through various efforts, and has put it as one of their priorities. "China cannot develop in isolation from the world, nor can the world develop by shutting out China," he said. "China is ready to work with the rest of the international community to build an open world economy, [a] community with a shared future for mankind and together create a brighter future."
