Mir Castle, also known as Mirsky Castle or the Mir Castle Complex, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the town of Mir, Belarus. Construction work on this originally Gothic-style castle began at the end of the 15th century. During its long history, it has undergone many changes and renovations. It was later extended and reconstructed in both Renaissance and Baroque styles. The castle serves as a unique example of how conflicting architectural styles can be blended together, and now ranks among the most popular tourist attractions in Belarus. Two years prior to Mir Castle's induction as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, China's ancient imperial sacrificial altar in Beijing, the Temple of Heaven, joined this coveted list. The Temple of Heaven is a complex of imperial religious buildings situated in Beijing. The complex was visited by the emperors of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties for annual ceremonies offering prayers to heaven for a good harvest. The Temple of Heaven is an axial arrangement composed of three important architectures: the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, the Circular Mound Altar, and the Imperial Vault of Heaven. The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests is the most visited site among the three. It is a triple-gabled circular building that sits on a three-tiered marble stone base, where the emperor would pray for a good harvest. The building is completely wooden, with no nails. Both Mir Castle and the Temple of Heaven offer fascinating glimpses into the rich history and culture of Belarus and China, and are considered must-see destinations for overseas visitors. Efforts have been made recently to promote tourism between China and Belarus, with the goal of increasing mutual understanding and cultural exchanges. Belarus has opened a visa-free program for Chinese tourists. This has drawn more visitors from China in the past decade and is expected to see a boom this year as travel demand spikes among many Chinese.
