China expressed firm opposition to the U.S. State Department's approval of a $619-million arms sales to China's Taiwan region, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Thursday. The move is a serious violation of the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, especially the August 17 Communique, Ma said, adding that such sales support and connive with "Taiwan independence" separatist forces and jeopardize the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. Ma urged the U.S. to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, stop arms sales to Taiwan and cease military contact. He also urged the U.S. to stop "playing with fire" on the Taiwan question and deal with it carefully. The spokesperson warned the Democratic Progressive Party authorities that attempts to reject reunification with force and seek independence by relying on the U.S. are doomed to fail. (Cover via CFP)
