To achieve the 2023 gross domestic product (GDP) growth target of around 5 percent on the current high base of China's economic output is not an easy task and requires redoubled efforts, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said Monday. The notable institutional strength is one of the advantages for China's economic development, he said. Li said China's economic performance over the first two months of 2023 has shown that the economy is stabilizing and picking up again. Noting some international organizations have revised up the projections of China's growth in 2023, Li voiced full confidence in the prospect of the country's economy.
