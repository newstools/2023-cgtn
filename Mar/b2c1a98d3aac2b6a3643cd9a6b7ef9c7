China's aircraft family is growing, Tang Changhong, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and chief model designer at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China Ltd., said on Saturday. This year marks the 10th anniversary of military transport aircraft the Y-20's maiden flight, and last year the country's first domestically-developed large passenger aircraft, the C919, completed all its test flights. Together with the AG600 large amphibious aircraft, China's aircraft family is growing, Tang said at the "Members' Corridor" on the sidelines of the Two Sessions at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. To achieve a high level of self-reliance and strength in science and technology, an aviation worker should be capable of conducting what his country needs and can use, Tang said.
