Novak Djokovic has withdrawn from next week's ATP/WTA Indian Wells Masters event, organizers confirmed on Sunday. Djokovic is unable to enter the United States because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19, but he had petitioned U.S. authorities for a special permission to enter. The United States still doesn't allow unvaccinated international travelers to enter the country, with the Transportation Security Administration recently indicating the policy would not change until at least mid-April.
