Donald Trump is seeking a six-month delay to meet deadlines for gathering evidence in the New York attorney general's fraud case against the former U.S. president, Reuters reported. The request if granted would likely push back the scheduled October 2 trial well into 2024, deep into that year's presidential campaign. Trump is seeking a second White House term. Attorney General Letitia James sued Trump and the other defendants in September over their alleged roles in a decade-long scheme to manipulate asset values and Trump's net worth to win better terms from banks and insurers.
