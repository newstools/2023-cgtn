The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, has set a plan for the legislative work this year, according to a report presented to the ongoing NPC session for deliberation on Tuesday. According to the report, the NPC Standing Committee will improve methods for carrying out oversight and ensure that oversight is conducted in an appropriate, effective and lawful way. "We should focus our oversight on the targets and tasks set at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the major decisions and plans made by the CPC Central Committee. We should align our oversight with people's concerns, expectations and wishes, and we should ensure that the work of state institutions is carried out in concert," the report said. "In hearing and deliberating reports, we should maintain our focus on advancing high-quality development. We should conduct oversight of the major matters approved at this session. We should strengthen examination and oversight of government budgets and final accounts and enhance oversight over state-owned asset management, implementation of laws, supervision and judicial work." The NPC also looks to ensure constitutional implementation and carry out legislative work. "We should improve institutions and procedures for constitutional review, improve the recording and review system for normative documents, and ensure order in the special administrative regions as stipulated in China's Constitution and the Basic Laws. We should uphold the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus and stand firm in advancing national reunification," the report said. The NPC will also work faster to make laws that improve people's well-being, promote scientific and technological, social and cultural progress, and protect the environment, according to the report.
