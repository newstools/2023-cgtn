Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was on an official visit in Kyiv, called on Wednesday for the extension of a deal with Moscow that has allowed Kyiv to export grain via Black Sea ports. Zelenskyy said after talks with Guterres that the Black Sea Grain Initiative was necessary for the world, and Guterres underlined the importance of the deal to global food security and food prices. "I want to underscore the critical importance of rolling over the Black Sea Grain Initiative on March 18 and working to create the conditions to enable the greatest possible use of export infrastructure through the Black Sea in line with the objectives of the initiative," Guterres told reporters at a joint press conference with Zelenskyy. The 120-day deal, initially brokered by the United Nations and TÃ¼rkiye in July and extended in November, will be renewed on March 18 if no party objects. Russia has signaled that obstacles to its own agricultural exports need to be removed before it lets the deal continue. (With input from Reuters)
