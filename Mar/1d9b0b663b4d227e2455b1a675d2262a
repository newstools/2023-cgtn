What happens when the U.S. fears a rising competitor and its two main parties are at loggerheads? It whips up a "Chinese spy balloon" hysteria to trigger collective rage against China and cause a distraction from its own failures and transgressions. In this episode of Reality Check, CGTN's Wang Guan comes up with a new acronym to describe Washington politicians' behavior: BBB -- Bonding through Beijing Bashing. It's to hide the inconvenient truth that it's the U.S. that's been spying on other countries through surveillance balloons, including the former USSR and China. Though President Biden says he doesn't want a new Cold War, his China policy is compromised by his need to please the Republicans.
