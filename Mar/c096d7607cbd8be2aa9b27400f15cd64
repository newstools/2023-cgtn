China never attaches any political strings to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation, Wang Chao, spokesperson for the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC), stressed at a press conference on Saturday. Wang opened the news event by stating that since the BRI was proposed a decade ago, its circle of friends has continued to expand. More than 150 countries and over 30 international organizations have signed cooperation documents. The event was held by the NPC, the country's national legislature, ahead of its annual session. The BRI has continued to deepen practical cooperation, and has made contributions to economic development, job creation and the improvement of people's livelihood in various countries. "To carry out the BRI, China never attaches any political strings and never seeks any political self-interest," Wang said. China is willing to work with partners in the joint construction of the BRI to accomplish new achievements, he added.
