During Xi Jinping's inspection tour in Jinhua City, east China's Zhejiang Province in 2004, Typhoon Rananim hit the entire downtown area of Taizhou City, which trapped more than 6,000 people. Xi, then Party chief ofÂ Zhejiang, insisted on taking a rescue boat to visit those affected. "People and lives are the top priorities. The Party is willing to protect people's life and health at all costs," Xi said.
