The attack by Ukrainian saboteurs in the border region of the Bryansk region is a "terrorist act," Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday, adding that Ukrainian militants opened fire on civilians. Moscow said a group of armed Ukrainians had crossed into Russia's Bryansk region, fired on a car, killing one person and wounding a child, and were holding hostages in a shop near the border. "We are talking about a terrorist attack. Measures are now being taken to destroy these terrorists," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhaylo Podolyak said on Thursday via Twitter that reports of a sabotage attack by Ukrainian forces in Bryansk are a "deliberate provocation." (With input from Reuters)
