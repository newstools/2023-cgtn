A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Friday criticized Japan's nuclear-contaminated water discharge plan, urging Japan not to start ocean dumping before fully consulting with the stakeholders and relevant international organizations. Mao Ning, the spokesperson, made the remarks at a regular press briefing when asked to comment on the accusation of Suh Kune-yull, a professor emeritus of Nuclear Energy System Engineering at Seoul National University, on Japan insisting on discharging the water into the ocean, which he said is tantamount to launching a terrorist attack against the Pacific Ocean. "We have noted that many experts and scholars have made strong criticisms over Japan's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water from Fukushima into the ocean," Mao said. She said that Japan has obligations under international law to prevent the pollution of the environment and ensure minimization of the hazard. The technical task force of the International Atomic Energy Agency has yet to complete its assessment of Japan's discharge plan, still less reach a final conclusion. The Japanese side, without full consultation with stakeholders, went ahead with approving the discharge plan and accelerated the construction of discharge facilities, Mao said, calling the move extremely irresponsible. Stressing that the disposal of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water bears on the global marine environment and public health, Mao said it is not Japan's domestic affair. China urges Japan to take seriously the legitimate concerns of all parties, earnestly live up to its obligations, place itself under the strict monitoring of the international community, dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water in a science-based, open, transparent and safe manner, including assessing the alternatives to ocean discharge, Mao said. "Japan must not start discharging the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean before reaching consensus through full consultation with neighboring countries and other stakeholders as well as relevant international agencies," the spokesperson said.
