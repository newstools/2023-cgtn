Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of Ligue 1 will submit their bid for the Stade de France, the largest stadium in France, as an alternative option for home field if they move away from the Parc des Princes, according to Reuters on Friday. In a deal reached with the Paris City Council in 2013, PSG extended their lease of the Parc des Princes until 2043. Then the club spent 75 million euros (about $79.8 million) completing an upgrade of the stadium over three years. In November 2022, there were reports about PSG willing to buy the Parc des Princes, but the club's president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, told Marca that they don't feel welcomed in the stadium. Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, told reporters that the Parc des Princes was not for sale. Reuters reported that PSG will submit their bid for the Stade de France, but the club prefers a 'renovated' Parc des Princes, which has been their home stadium since 1974. The Stade de France has a bigger capacity that the Perc des Princes, with a maximum of about 80,000. It held the FIFA World Cup final in 1998 and the UEFA Champions League final last season. The track and field events of the 2024 Summer Olympic Games will take place at the Stade de France as well. The lease for the Stade de France is held by a consortium of the French companies Vinci and Bouygues. If PSG want to buy the stadium, it won't happen until after 2025. According to Reuters, PSG also keep a third option of building a new stadium outside Paris. PSG are currently leading Ligue 1 with 63 points after 26 games. They are eight points above the second-ranking Olympique de Marseille. The club has been nothing but dominant in the French top league since they were taken over by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011 and have won the Ligue 1 title eight times. Nonetheless, PSG have never won the Champions League, from which they were eliminated by Bayern Munich in Round of 16 this week.
