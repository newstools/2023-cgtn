China will keep in mind the interests of the world, take an active part in global governance, and contribute more to world peace and development and human progress, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Tuesday. Qin made the remarks at a press conference held on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress in Beijing. "Through the past 10 years in the new era, President Xi Jinping has put forward a host of major initiatives and proposals," Qin said. "The core message of these initiatives is that countries are interdependent, mankind have a shared future, and the international community must get united for cooperation," he said. Developing countries account for more than 80 percent of the global population and more than 70 percent of global economic growth. People in these countries are entitled to a better life, and developing countries are entitled to greater representation and a louder voice in international affairs, Qin noted. He stressed that global governance should be promoted in accordance with the law and the principles of international law enshrined in the UN Charter. Equity and justice must be upheld while hegemonism and selfish interests must be rejected, and solidarity must be defended while division and confrontation must be abandoned, he said.
