Deputy to the 14th National People's Congress, Yang Denghui, took to heart the country's call for high-quality development. Yang, an instructor at Guangdong Machinery Technician College, said nurturing more all-round workers in the manufacturing sector should be the top priority for high-quality development, as workers are the ones who convert theoretical designs into actual products. "Companies these days are not like those 20 years ago, which depended heavily on basic manual labor. Many have introduced automated assembly lines and robots," he told CGTN. "They no longer require heavy labor and have started looking for intelligence-based workers." The 26-year-old hopes to create a training platform that combines both skill- and intelligence-based training, and to eliminate bias for skilled workers.
