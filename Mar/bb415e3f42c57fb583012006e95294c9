U.S. state regulators closed New York-based Signature Bank on Sunday, days after California authorities shuttered Silicon Valley Bank, in a collapse that roiled global markets and stranded billions of dollars in uninsured corporate and individual deposits. The U.S. Treasury Department and other banking regulators said in a joint statement on Sunday that all Signature Bank depositors will be made whole and that "no losses will be borne by the taxpayer."
