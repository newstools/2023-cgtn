China always sees Europe as a comprehensive strategic partner, spokesperson of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) said at a press conference on Saturday. Responding to a question on China-Europe relations, spokesperson Wang Chao said it is natural for China and Europe to hold different views on certain issues, as they are different in history, culture, development level and ideology, calling for both sides to maintain communication and consultation with a constructive attitude. "There are no fundamentally strategic differences and conflicts, but widely common interests and cooperation foundation accumulated in a long-term, between China and Europe," Wang said. To portray China and Europe as "systemic competitors," "China challenge," or "China threat" is a cold-war mindset and ideological bias, he added. Leaders of China and Europe have reached important consensusesÂ in their interactions, with both sides agreeing to work for the sound and stable development of China-Europe relations, reject a "new Cold War" and block confrontation and economic "decoupling", Wang said. "China-Europe relations have grown steadily since last year." Both sides also agreed to stand for upholding the UN-centered international system, safeguarding international economic and trade rules and order, and practicing multilateralism, he added. China supports the European Union's (EU) strategic autonomy, Europe's unity and prosperity, and the EU's constructive role in international affairs. It is hoped that China and the European side will join hands to tackle global challenges, such as climate change, promote political solutions to international and regional hotspot issues, and make greater contributions to world peace and development, Wang said. The first session of the 14th NPC will open at 9:00 a.m. on Sunday and conclude on March 13.
