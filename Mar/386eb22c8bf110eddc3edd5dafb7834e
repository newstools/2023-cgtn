Thomas Harney left the U.S. over 15 years ago to visit Beijing as a professional DJ. In the interim, his life took a series of unexpected twists and turns, and he has now settled in Changsha, where he is loving life as a kindergarten teacher and father of two young children. Â In "China Highly Recommended," Thomas explains how he ended up relocating from the Chinese capital and settling in the city. As he spent more time with his growing family, he decided to switch careers and swap the DJ decks for school classrooms and teaching materials. However, his love of music remained undiminished, and he has since set up a home studio where he continues to channel his passion and churn out fresh beats.
