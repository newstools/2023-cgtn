China's Tianzhou-6 cargo spacecraft was on its way to the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in the southern province of Hainan on Sunday, having left the factory after completing necessary work, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA). The spacecraft is aiming for a May launch. It will bring supplies and spacesuits for the astronauts, maintenance components, application facilities, and propellant to the station. The Shenzhou-15 crew currently stationed at the space station is in good health and expected to return to Earth in June. The astronauts for the following two manned missions have been selected and are currently undergoing training. Besides Tianzhou-6, the country plans to launch other manned missions, namely Shenzhou-16 and Shenzhou-17, this year as well. It's the first year for China to send out flight missions after construction of the space station was completed last year. Complying with the principles of peaceful use, equality, mutual benefit and inclusive development, China has persistently carried out international cooperation and exchanges with countries and regions around the world, promoting the peaceful use of outer space. The first batch of experiment projects selected by CMSA and the Office for Outer Space Affairs under the United Nations will be sent to the space station this year for research.
