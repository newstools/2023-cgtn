China has confidence and ability to achieve the consumer price index (CPI) target in 2023, Li Chunlin, vice chairmen of China's top economic planner the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said in a press conference on Monday. Its CPI target is around 3 percent in 2023, according to a government work report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang. China kept its CPI below 3 percent every month in 2022, and the average CPI was 2 percent last year, which contrasts sharply with high global inflation, said Li. Li also said that China's grain output has remained above 650 million tonnes for many years, the production capacity of hogs is adequate, its commodities supply is abundant, and its energy supply is secure and reliable, which all fully demonstrate that China has a solid foundation for price stability. To further stabilize prices, the NDRC will maintain the supply of critical commodities, ensure a stable energy supply, and keep coal prices within a reasonable range, said the vice chairman.
