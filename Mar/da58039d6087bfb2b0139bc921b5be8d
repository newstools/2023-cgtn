China ensured food security and vigorously implemented the rural revitalization strategy during the past five years, according to a government work report delivered by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at the opening meeting of the first session of China's 14th National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Sunday. The country strengthened the protection of croplands, launched an initiative to protect chernozem soils, improved water conservancy infrastructure, and increased the area of high-standard cropland by 30.4 million hectares in the past five years, according to the work report. The rate of mechanization in the plowing, planting and harvesting of crops was raised from 67 percent to 73 percent, the report said. 'Advance rural revitalization' China aims to stabilize grain output and advance rural revitalization this year, according to the government work report. China will also invigorate the seed industry and support the development of agricultural science, technology, and equipment, it said. The report also called for fostering rural industries with local features to create more channels for increasing rural incomes. "Our achievements in poverty alleviation should be consolidated and expanded to prevent large-scale relapse into poverty," it said.
