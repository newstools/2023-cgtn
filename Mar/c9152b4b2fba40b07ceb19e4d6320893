China's top advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), has achieved better performance in the past five years, said Wang Yang, chairman of the 13th National Committee of the CPPCC, on Saturday. A total of 105 key political consultative events were held during the five-year term of the 13th National Committee of the CPPCC, Wang said at the opening meeting of the first session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee, part of China's annual "Two Sessions" political event. Delivering a work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee, Wang said they also held 74 consultations on a smaller scale around the topics of common prosperity, basic education and rural modernization. Wang highlighted the implementation of democratic supervision functions of the CPPCC, as key issues like veterans' benefits and black soil protection were listed in the annual consultation plans, adding that the CPPCC's supervision helped with the implementation of national policies. The CPPCC has improved its internal working procedures, forming a rule-based system in accordance with law and policies, Wang said. The organization has also promoted a consultative culture that encourages free speech and expression in a rational and lawful manner. Wang also noted that the CPPCC has improved its work at local levels.
