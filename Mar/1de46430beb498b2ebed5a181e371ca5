The opening of China's 2023 Two Sessions attracts the world's attention. People from many countries say China's development is of great importance to the world and its development experience is worth learning. They also expect to learn more about China's future domestic and foreign policies through the Two Sessions. Jeff Greene, chairman of the Sino-American Aviation Heritage Foundation, tells China Media Group (CMG) that the Two Sessions is going to be an important meeting for China and the world, adding that the measures taken on China's future economic development will have a huge impact on the world. "China strengthened ecological environment protection and promoted green and low-carbon development in the past five years, achieving sustainable development," said Phosy Keomanivong, vice minister of the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism in Laos, adding that this kind of development concept is what enables China's economy to achieve sustained and comprehensive development. Former Ambassador of Venezuela to Cuba Adan Chavez tells CMG that his country needs to learn from China about how to achieve great victories like poverty alleviation, one of the greatest achievements China has made. People from various countries say China pursues the concept of win-win cooperation and advances the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which will bring opportunities to the countries involved. "Seeking win-win cooperation instead of confrontation is the idea conveyed by the BRI," Everisto Benyera, a professor at the University of South Africa, tells CMG.
