How to resolve the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese people and no other country has the right to interfere in it, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Tuesday at a press conference held on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress in Beijing. "We will work with the greatest sincerity and exert utmost efforts to achieve peaceful reunification, but will reserve the option of taking all necessary measures," Qin said. The Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations, he said. "Why does the U.S. talk at length about respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity on Ukraine while disrespecting China's sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Taiwan question? Why does the U.S. ask China not to provide weapons for Russia while it keeps selling arms to Taiwan in violation of the August 17 Communiqué? Why does the U.S. keep on professing the maintenance of regional peace and stability while covertly formulating a plan for the 'destruction of Taiwan'?" Qin questioned. The U.S. holds undeniable responsibilities for causing the Taiwan question, he said, urging the U.S. side stop containing China by exploiting the Taiwan question and return to the fundamental of the one-China principle. For peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, its real threat is the separatist forces for Taiwan independence, its solid anchor is the one-China principle, and its genuine guardrails are the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, he said. The foreign minister warned that mishandling of the Taiwan question will shake the very foundation of China-U.S. relations.
