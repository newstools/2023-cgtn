China's top legislator Li Zhanshu on Wednesday called for strengthened exchanges and cooperation between the legislatures of the country and Belarus during a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Beijing. Li, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, noted that China-Belarus relations have been upgraded to an all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership thanks to the guidance of the two heads of state, and Chinese modernization will bring new opportunities to the international community including Belarus. Li said China is willing to make joint efforts with Belarus to fully implement the key consensus between the two heads of state, and facilitate greater development of China-Belarus relations and their all-round cooperation. China firmly supports Belarus in safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and stands ready to work closely with Belarus to safeguard the common interests of the two countries and other developing countries, Li said. The legislatures of the two countries should strengthen exchanges and cooperation to better promote the development of the two countries, Li added. Lukashenko said Belarus firmly supports the one-China principle, supports China's cause of peaceful reunification, and opposes any acts that interfere in China's internal affairs, adding that both sides should firmly support each other on issues concerning their core interests. Belarus is willing to work with China to deepen economic and trade cooperation, expand people-to-people exchanges, support each other in international affairs and push forward the all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries, Lukashenko added.
