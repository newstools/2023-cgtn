In the movie "Wandering Earth II," the main character Tu Hengyu saw a creature floating upright in the water. He was told that it was a largehead hairtail that was sleeping. Like the body structure of the largehead hairtail, it maintains an upright posture during periods of inactivity, thereby reducing exertion. As a fierce predatory fish, it requires a lot of physical and mental energy during meal times. Through this posture, it can sleep and rest to restore its physical energy. What other animals have peculiar sleeping postures? Whales usually use the air holes in the top of their heads to obtain air at the surface of the water. This requires them to stay awake while resting in order to get to the surface to breathe, so many whales can take turns using both sides of their brain to rest. Seahorses anchor themselves by curling their tails around seaweed and coral as they sleep. This keeps them from being swept away by the water and hides them from enemies. Parrotfish will exhale a large bubble to wrap themselves in when they sleep, this is to hide their breath, if the bubble breaks they will wake up.
