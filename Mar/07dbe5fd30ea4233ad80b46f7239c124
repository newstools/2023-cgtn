Deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) have submitted 271 motions and 8,500 suggestions as of Sunday, said an official from the NPC Standing Committee. Submitting motions and suggestions is one of the major duties of NPC deputies who are elected by the people to represent the public's interests. The motions that NPC deputies submit will become legally binding once adopted. But first, they need to get at least 30 signatures for each submission. So far, 69 legislative items from the motions have been included in legislative planning work of the NPC Standing Committee this year. "The quality of motions this year improved a lot. For example, 60 percent of the motions we received this year are attached with the text of draft laws, which is a remarkable progress," said Fu Wenjie, deputy head of the working group that handles motions and suggestions. Fu said deputies' suggestions cover a wide range of areas, including upgrading real economy development, accelerating agricultural modernization and enhancing medical services at grassroots level. The NPC Standing Committee has also developed a platform to provide all procedures for addressing motions and suggestions online, including submissions, communications and feedback, which has improved deputies' working efficiency. But the working group said they haven't stopped receiving paper submissions, because they want to ensure that all deputies, including those older or less tech-savvy ones, can exercise their rights of submitting motions and putting forward suggestions.
