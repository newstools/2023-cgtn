With its Tianhui-6 twin satellites sent into space on Friday morning, the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) has now developed and successfully launched a total of 400 spacecraft. The two satellites were launched on a Long March-4C carrier rocket and will be used for geographic mapping, land resource surveys, scientific experiments and other tasks. CAST, affiliated with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), is also the developer of China's first satellite Dongfanghong-1. The CASC plans to launch more than 200 spacecraft in about 60 space missions in 2023 and will see the 500th flight mission of the Long March carrier rocket series this year. Three flight missions, namely the launches of the Tianzhou-6 cargo craft as well as the Shenzhou-16 and Shenzhou-17 manned spaceships, should take place within the year to improve the country's capability of entering, using and exploring space, said the CASC. It added that three backup satellites for the BeiDou-3 Navigation Satellite System will be sent into space this year.
