The Central Axis of Beijing was built during the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368) and has since undergone various stages of renovation and expansion as it has evolved over the centuries. The design and construction of this central axis was based on the old city plan and traditional Chinese culture. Most of the important architecture in Beijing was constructed along this axis, such as the Temple of Heaven, Tian'anmen Square, the Forbidden City, and Jingshan Hill. The axis stands at the heart of the city, representing China's history, spatial design, urban landscape and cultural value. The Central Axis of Beijing stretches from the Bell Tower and Drum Tower in the north of the city to Yongding Gate in the south, spanning 7.8 kilometers in total. Bells and drums were used to announce the time in past centuries. The Bell Tower and Drum Tower were built to serve a similar function in 1272 during the Yuan Dynasty. Since then, they have experienced several periods of renovation. The Bell Tower and Drum Tower were opened to the public in the 1980s and are now popular tourist spots in the capital. The Drum Tower is 46.7 meters tall, with two stories housing 25 drums. The Bell Tower is slightly taller, at 47.9 meters, and also comprises two stories with a gray edifice. They were both made from wood based on elaborate architectural designs and delicate patterns. These archaic architectures have experienced many vicissitudes, standing as symbols of Chinese history and culture as well as the wisdom of ancient Chinese. They remain an integral part of the city's landscape, ready to witness more changes in Beijing's ongoing development.
