Young panda cubs have been getting more adventurous as they learn key skills including tree-climbing at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in southwest China's Sichuan Province.Recently-released footage showed the panda cub launching itself onto the unsuspecting staff member's back while she was teaching another cub how to climb the tree. The naughty cub, which was born last year, then clung onto the breeder for a while, demanding her full attention.Â The Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding is a world-renowned institution for the ex-situ conservation of giant pandas, scientific research and breeding, public education and tourism. The base is famous for its work in protecting and breeding giant pandas, red pandas and other endangered wild animals exclusive to China.
