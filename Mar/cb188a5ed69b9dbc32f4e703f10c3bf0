Chinese modernization offers solutions to many challenges facing human development, Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Tuesday. He made the remarks at a press conference held on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress in Beijing. Achieving the modernization of a country of more than 1.4 billion people will be an unprecedented feat in human history, one of profound global significance in itself, Qin told reporters. "It busts the myth that modernization is westernization. It creates a new form of human advancement, and it provides an important source of inspiration for the world, especially developing countries," he said. China's success proves that every country has the right and ability to choose its own path and to hold its future firmly in its own hands, he said. Chinese modernization has provided important inspirations for other countries by putting the people first and as the modernization of common prosperity for all, the foreign minister said. Moreover, Chinese modernization is not pursued through war, colonization or plundering, Qin explained. It is dedicated to peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit, and committed to harmony between humanity and nature, providing a new path different from western modernization, Qin said. He also pointed out the importance of openness and inclusiveness of modernization. It is important to encourage exchange and mutual learning, so that all countries will flourish and prosper together, he added. China's success also proves that only by striving in unity can we pool strength, he said, adding that partisan rift, empty talk and frequent policy flip-flop as seen in certain countries will only make even the best blueprint an illusion and a castle in the air.
