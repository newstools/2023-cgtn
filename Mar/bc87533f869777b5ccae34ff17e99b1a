Team China won the World Wheelchair Curling Championship after defeating host Canada 5-2 in Richmond, Canada on Sunday. As the 2018 and 2022 Paralympic Winter Games winner, the Chinese squad comprised both new and seasoned players. The team is skipped by Wang Haitao, followed by second Yang Jinqiao, third Zhang Shuaiyu, lead Li Nana, supported by Zhang Mingliang and coach Li Jianrui. With only single points traded in the first half, the four-player championship final was tied 2-2 after five ends. China had the opportunity to blank in the sixth end, but opted to draw for a single point and go up 3-2. In the seventh end, led by skip Mark Ideson, Canada attempted to set up for their two points, but rolled out on a hit, leaving themselves with a blank end to have the last stone in the eighth and final end. Canada fourth Jon Thurston faced a draw to the four-foot rings against multiple Chinese stones to tie the game, but could not deliver and handed the victory to China. "I am so happy and excited. My teammates are great! You can always trust the Chinese wheelchair curling team." Zhang Mingliang said after the game. It is also special for 33-year-old skip Wang, "through our team's efforts, we won the trophy. I am very glad. This is my third title in the world championships." China's main coach Yue Qingshuang said that the team would next aim for the Milan Paralympics in 2026.
