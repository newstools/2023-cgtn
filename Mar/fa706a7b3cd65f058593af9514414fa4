China's foreign ministry on Wednesday expressed opposition to the EU's banning of TikTok from government employees' phones, saying constant restrictions on foreign companies in the name of national security will only harm international confidence in its business environment. "The EU should respect market rules and stop generalizing the concept of national security, and should provide an environment of fair play for foreign companies," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.
