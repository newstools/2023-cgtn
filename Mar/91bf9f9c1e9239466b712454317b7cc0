Former Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was questioned by Malaysia's anti-graft agency on Thursday, following allegations that his party misused public funds meant to fight COVID-19, local media reported. Muhyiddin was prime minister for 17 months between 2020 and 2021, at the height of Malaysia's battle against the coronavirus, and now leads an opposition coalition. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has not commented on why they are questioning Muhyiddin, but it came weeks after it launched the probe into the alleged misuse of pandemic funds by Bersatu, his political party. The 75-year-old said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that he had been asked to appear before MACC, but did not say why. Muhyiddin Yassin will be charged on Friday for corruption-related offences, state media Bernama reported on Thursday, citing the MACC chief Azam Baki.
