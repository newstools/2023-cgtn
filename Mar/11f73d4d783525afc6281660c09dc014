The death toll rose to 40 after two trains collided in Greece, China Media Group reported on Wednesday. A passenger train and a cargo train collided head-on in Greece on Tuesday night, resulting in heavy casualties as the country's deadliest rail crash in decades threw entire carriages off the tracks. Sixty-six of those injured were hospitalized, six of whom are in intensive care, a fire official said. The crash occurred as the passenger train emerged from a tunnel. Derailed carriages, badly damaged with broken windows and thick plumes of smoke, could be seen on the site, where rescuers were looking for more survivors. Greece on Wednesday declared a three-day national mourning from March 1 to 3 for the victims of the train accident, local media Greek City Times reported. During the mourning, the Greek flag will fly at half-mast at all public buildings, and all public celebrations are canceled. Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou said on Wednesday that she was cutting short her visit to Moldova to return to Greece following the train collision. "Unfortunately, I have to interrupt my visit in order to be close to my people, to support those who need it," she said. So far, no Chinese casualties have been reported in the train collision, the Chinese Embassy in Greece told China Media Group. (With input from Reuters)
