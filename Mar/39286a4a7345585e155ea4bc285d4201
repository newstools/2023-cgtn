Greek Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis has submitted his resignation after a deadly train collision in the country. In a statement posted on Facebook, he said resigning was his duty and "the least he could do to honor the memory of the victims," adding that he was undertaking the responsibility for the state's "long-standing failures." The cause of the crash near the Vale of Tempe, about 380 kilometers north of Athens, remains unclear. Police arrested the stationmaster in the nearby city of Larissa on Wednesday, and another two people have been detained for questioning. (With input from agencies)
