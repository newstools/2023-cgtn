For too long, China's political system has been misportrayed and even demonized by certain countries and their media. Yet, few really try to understand how it actually works, and how it successfully broadly involves Chinese people of every group in the government's decision-making and policy-making process. In this vlog, CGTN reporter Li Jingjing, who is covering the ongoing 2023 Two Sessions, explains how China's whole-process people's democracy makes sure the wills of Chinese people from different groups are represented at China's highest organ of state power. She also interviewed deputies from various regions and ethnic groups at the Great Hall of the People to understand what proposals and advice they are bringing to the National People's Congress, which will further improve their hometowns and sectors.
