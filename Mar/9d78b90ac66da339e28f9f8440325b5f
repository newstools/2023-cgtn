On March 7, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang held a press conference on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress. He said that the U.S.'s claim of shaping the strategic environment in which China operates reveals the real purpose of its Indo-Pacific Strategy, and that is to encircle China. This is bound to fail. China's policies towards its neighbor have always been a top priority, and it's relationships with its neighbors are built on mutual benefits and achieving developments together. These relationships can't be easily ripped apart by people from an ocean away.
