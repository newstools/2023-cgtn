One of the striking features of Yunjin brocade is the use of precious metals such as gold and silver. Even the feathers of rare birds can be integrated into the fabric. The gold thread, as thin as a cicada's wing, is very fragile and easily broken. Only in the most experienced hands can it be woven into a piece of Yunjin brocade.
