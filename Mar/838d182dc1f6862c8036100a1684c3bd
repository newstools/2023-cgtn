An international standard on digital retina systems led by Pengcheng Laboratory, IEEE 3161-2022, was released byÂ the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) on February 27. The Shenzhen-based research institution said it is the first international standard on end-edge-cloud collaborative technology. The "end-edge-cloud" mainly refers to three components of edge computing, including the edge devices like smart speakers, watches and phones, network edge, and on-premises infrastructure like servers and routers. A digital retina is a biologically-inspired visual computing framework, in which the video, feature and model stream can work collaboratively for real time analysis and processing of video big data. It can be applied to smart city, intelligent transportation, intelligent manufacturing and other fields, according to the laboratory. The standard defined the architecture, components, and functional requirements of digital retina systems. It laid a foundation for the development of a complete, scientific and reasonable digital retina standard system, said the laboratory on its WeChat official account. (Cover via CFP)
