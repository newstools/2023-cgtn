The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Saturday blamed the United States for what it said was the collapse of international arms control systems, adding that Pyongyang's nuclear weapons were a just response that ensured peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. The DPRK's foreign ministry said in a commentary carried by state news agency KCNA that the United States, South Korea and Japan were crossing a danger line, and this should not be tolerated.
