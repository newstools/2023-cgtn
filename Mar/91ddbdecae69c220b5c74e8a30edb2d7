There is no shortage of kindness and goodwill in China's diplomacy, but when faced with "jackals or wolves," Chinese diplomats would have no choice but to confront them head on to protect the motherland, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Tuesday on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress in Beijing. The minister made the statement while refuting a claim that the country had adopted the so-called "wolf warrior diplomacy." The "wolf warrior diplomacy" term is a narrative trap, and those who coined it and set up the trap are either ignorant of China and its diplomacy, or driven by a hidden agenda in disregard of facts, Qin added.
