The Chinese mainland on Thursday urged Taiwan to restore the normal operations of direct flights across the Taiwan Straits as soon as possible. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks at a press conference when asked to comment on the Taiwan authorities' decision to resume more direct flights to mainland destinations starting from Friday. Ma stated that the decision, made after the mainland's February request to Taiwan authorities to restore 16 nonstop flight destinations such as Guangzhou, is consistent with the need to completely resume cross-strait direct passenger flights. He stressed that peace, development, exchange and cooperation are the common aspiration of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and the resumption of direct flights is conducive to cross-strait personnel exchanges, as well as enhancing cooperation and communication between the two sides. He urged the Taiwan authorities to align with the people's will, and promote the normalization of direct flights, direct shipping and the "mini three links" as soon as possible, to enhance the common interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
