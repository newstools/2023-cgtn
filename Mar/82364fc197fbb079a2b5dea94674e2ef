The U.S.'s Indo-Pacific strategy is in fact an attempt to gang up to form exclusive blocs, to provoke confrontation by plotting an Asia-Pacific version of NATO, and to undermine regional integration through decoupling and cutting chains, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said Tuesday. He made the remarks at a press conference held on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress in Beijing. "The U.S. claim to 'shape the strategic environment in which China operates' actually reveals the real purpose of its Indo-Pacific strategy, that is to encircle China. Such an attempt will only disrupt the ASEAN-centered, open and inclusive regional cooperation architecture, and undermine the overall and long-term interests of regional countries. It is bound to fail," said Qin. Qin said Asia should be a stage for win-win cooperation rather than a chessboard for geopolitical contest, adding that no Cold War should be reignited, and no Ukraine-style crisis should be repeated in Asia. "As for who to rely on in terms of security and economy, I believe it is necessary to stand together in face of difficulties, jointly pursue security and development, and work together to build a closer community with a shared future in the neighborhood," he said.
