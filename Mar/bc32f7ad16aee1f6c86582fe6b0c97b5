China always firmly opposes long-arm jurisdiction which abuses the extraterritorial application of domestic law to suppress foreign entities and individuals, Wang Chao, spokesperson for the first session of the 14th National People's Congress, said at a press conference on Saturday. China's core interests must not be undermined, its sovereignty and territorial integrity must not be infringed upon, Wang said. It is legitimate and necessary for China to introduce foreign relations laws, such as the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law of the People's Republic of China, to resolutely counteract acts that harm China's sovereignty, security and development interests and infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens, he said.
