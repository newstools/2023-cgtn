Syria's foreign ministry on Sunday condemned the visit of the top U.S. military officer to a U.S. base in northeast Syria as "illegal" and a "flagrant violation" of the country's sovereignty, state news agency SANA reported. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley made the unannounced visit on Saturday to assess a nearly eight-year-old mission there and to review safeguards for U.S. troops against attack.
