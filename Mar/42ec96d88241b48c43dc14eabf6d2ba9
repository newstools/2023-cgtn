A report of the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office on China's World Trade Organization (WTO) compliance exposes America's unilateral mindset and consistent hegemony and is strongly opposed by China, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Wednesday. China has vigorously advocated a multilateral trading system since its accession to the WTO over 20 years ago and has fulfilled its global commitments by refining its socialist market economy and legal system, a MOFCOM spokesperson said in a statement.
