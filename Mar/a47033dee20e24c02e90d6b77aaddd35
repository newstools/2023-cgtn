In "China Highly Recommended," former NCAA college football player Peter Kuhn from the U.S. showed his wide range of interests, many of them related to sport. Working as a fitness coach, he has been named a Hunan Fitness Champion, and even formed a band called the Peter Joseph Trio. Peter said he relishes his life in Changsha, not least because, with so many hobbies, he has made so many friends there. When he's not playing sport or music, he likes to hang out with his buddies, such as their recent get-togethers to watch the FIFA World Cup.
