Today is the 45th National Tree Planting Day. In the past 10 years, China has added more than 22 million hectares of forest. Generations of tree-planters are making our surroundings more vibrant. In 2022, China completed the afforestation of 3.83 million hectares and treated 1,847,300 hectares of rock-deserted land. After continuous effort, China has achieved remarkable progress, according to the Bulletin of China's Land Greening Status. China's forest coverage rate has reached 24 percent, and forest accumulation has reached 19 billion cubic meters, which has laid a solid foundation for maintaining national ecological security and improving people's well-being. In terms of vegetation conservation, China has issued a guideline to implement a forest chief scheme nationwide amid the country's continuous efforts to protect forests and grasslands. Principal leaders of local Party committees and governments should be appointed as "forest chiefs," which are set up at various levels ranging from provincial level to village level according to actual conditions, said the guideline published in 2020. Bazhou District in southwest China's Sichuan Province is an important biodiversity ecological zone in the country. In the past, the surface of the mountain there was exposed due to ore mining, but after the local government's management, the area has reverted back to its former green self. In terms of ecological civilization education, in Shanghai, for example, an elementary school has combined traditional Chinese medicine resources with AR technology to create a magical world for children to learn botany. Meanwhile, the city of Suzhou in Jiangsu Province, has digitized tree planting activities through a family greening show web display and a mini-game on how to identify different types of trees.
