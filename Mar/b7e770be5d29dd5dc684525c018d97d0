"China fully respects Middle Eastern countries as the masters of their own affairs. We have no intention to fill a so-called vacuum," Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said at a press conference held on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on Tuesday. "And we will not build exclusive circles," he added. In the Middle East, China will be a facilitator for peace and stability, a cooperative partner for development and prosperity, and an enabler for building strength through unity, Qin stressed.
