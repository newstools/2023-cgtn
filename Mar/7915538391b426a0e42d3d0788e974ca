Spanish world No. 2 and U.S. Open champion Carlos Alcaraz said on Tuesday that he was pulling out of this week's Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) event in Mexico's Acapulco due to a strained hamstring. Alcaraz, who was scheduled to play his opening match later in the day, picked up the injury during his loss to Cameron Norrie in Sunday's Rio Open final where the pain hindered both his movement and serve. "I have a grade 1 strain in my right hamstring that will keep me out for several days, according to the tests we did this morning," he wrote on Twitter. "I'm really sad I can't compete here, but now it's time to think about recovering and being ready as soon as possible. I hope to see you all soon!" Also on Tuesday, Rafael Nadal said he had decided to withdraw from two upcoming ATP Masters 1000 hardcourt events in Indian Wells and Miami due to injury. The 22-times Grand Slam champion, who has not competed since his Australian Open title defense ended in a second-round loss during which he aggravated a hip problem, said he had started rehabilitation and physiotherapy as instructed by doctors. "I am sad that I won't be able to compete at Indian Wells nor Miami. Very sad not to be there," read a message posted on Nadal's Twitter account. "I'll miss all my U.S. fans but I hope to see them later this year during the summer swing." (With input from Reuters)
