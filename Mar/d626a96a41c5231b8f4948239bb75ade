China's auto companies exported 329,000 vehicles in February, a surge of 82.8 percent compared with the same period last year, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) on Friday. Passenger vehicle exports increased 85.8 percent year on year to 271,000 units, while new energy vehicle (NEV) exports jumped 79.5 percent year on year to 87,000 units. The total number of China's auto sales in February climbed 13.5 percent relative to the year before, reaching almost 2 million units, according to CAAM. China has been implementing the purchase tax exemption policy since 2014 to shore up the development of the NEV sector. In September 2022, it extended the preferential tax policy until the end of 2023. China's NEV sales came in at about 6.89 million units in 2022, a skyrocketing 93.4 percent year on year increase, according to CAAM. (With input from Xinhua)
