The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday expressed opposition to the U.S. putting more than two dozen Chinese companies and individuals on an "entity list" of export control, calling for the U.S. to stop unreasonable oppression of Chinese enterprises. "We urge the U.S. to respect facts, abandon ideological prejudice, and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for foreign companies in the U.S.," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press conference. The Chinese side will take necessary measures to safeguard the lawful rights of Chinese enterprises, she added. China's Ministry of Commerce on Friday pledged necessary measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies after the U.S. added Chinese companies and individuals on an export control "entity list." The ministry urged the U.S. side to immediately correct its wrong practices and stop maliciously suppressing Chinese companies, it said in a press release.
