An exhibition of fine bronze works named "The Way of Molten Copper" by Zhu Bingren has been put on show at the China Grand Canal Museum in Yangzhou, east China's Jiangsu Province. As one of China's most highly acclaimed bronze art masters, Zhu Bingren has used his innovative vision to bring new vitality to this ancient craft â€“ the art of molten copper. Using his finely honed skills to control the liquid copper as it flows at a high temperature, he has injected new vitality into his art. His creations also deify randomness, and each work is unique. This exhibition showcases 68 of his most influential art pieces to present the breadth and highlights of his 40-year career. Dubbed "The Way of Molten Copper," the exhibition is part of a series of events themed around the "intangible cultural heritage along the Grand Canal." The aim is to showcase the enchanting power of these innovative forms of cultural heritage - bronze sculptures - along the Grand Canal. "In this exhibition, we have many works that are related to the history and cultural inheritance of the Grand Canal." Zhu said, "I hope to instill my ideas into each of my works, to let them 'speak' for themselves and be loved by everyone." Zhu Bingren has donated one of his signature bronze artworks called "Waves of Snowflakes" to the China Grand Canal Museum. It will form part of the museum's permanent collection. This work reflects the dynamic spirit of the culture of the Grand Canal over the past millennium. Many of Zhu Bingren's copper art pieces have also been exhibited in the United States, Singapore, Thailand, and many European countries over the past decade. Using art as a universal language, he has spread China's bronze art around the world, allowing more people to understand and appreciate China's culture and art.
