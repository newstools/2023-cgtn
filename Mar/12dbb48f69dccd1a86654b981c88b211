China-Belarus relations are based on mutual respect and mutual trust, and new progress has been made in mutually beneficial cooperation, said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday while meeting with visiting Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Beijing. Lukashenko is paying a state visit to China from Tuesday to Thursday at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Noting that China attaches great importance to developing China-Belarus relations, Li said the talks between the two heads of state will chart a comprehensive course for developing bilateral relations. It is hoped that the two sides will implement the consensus already reached, deepen practical cooperation, strengthen communication and coordination in international and regional affairs, safeguard world peace and stability and benefit the two peoples, said Li. On China-Belarus cooperation, Li said China is ready to work with Belarus to make good use of mechanisms, such as the inter-governmental cooperation committee.  He said effort is needed to build the China-Belarus Industrial Park and support enterprises of the two countries to carry out cooperation under market-oriented and commercial principles. The two sides should also strengthen trade in agricultural products and deepen people-to-people and sub-national exchanges and cooperation, Li said. Lukashenko thanked China for its support and assistance in Belarus's economic and social development, saying that Belarus is happy to see a strong and developing China and that bilateral cooperation is aimed at the benefit of the two peoples rather than targeting any third party. Belarus is willing to be China's friendly and cooperative partner and hopes to deepen cooperation with China in various fields and push forward the all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries, he said.
