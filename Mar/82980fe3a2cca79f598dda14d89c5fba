South Korean civil groups on Saturday rallied near the Office of the President in Seoul to protest against the upcoming military drills with the U.S. scheduled from March 13 to 23. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol on Friday vowed to strengthen deterrence against threats from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) by establishing a nuclear planning and implementation system with the United States. He also said South Korea will step up joint military drills with the U.S., which worried South Korean people that such large-scale drills could lead to direct confrontation.
