The NFL's New York Giants signed a four-year, $160 million contract extension with their quarterback (QB) Daniel Jones, according to ESPN. The deal contains $82 million guaranteed money at signing and $35 million in incentives. "We had productive conversations with Daniel and his representatives over the course of the past week or so," the Giants' general manager Joe Schoen said in a news release on Tuesday. "We are all pleased that we were able to come to an agreement prior to today's deadline. This gives us a greater ability to continue to build our roster." Having started 16 games for the Giants last season, Jones completed 317 of his 472 passes for 3,205 yards and 15 touchdowns. The team won nine games in the regular season and made the playoffs for the first time in six years. They upset the Minnesota Vikings 31-24 in the National Football Conference (NFC) Wild Card Game and then lost to the Philadelphia Eagles 38-7 in the NFC Divisional Round. "I said after the season I love this place," Jones said in a statement. "I've really enjoyed my time here and I want to be here. I have great respect for this organization, the Maras, the Tisches, my coaches and teammates. I am happy we were able to come to an agreement." Having reached a long-term extension with Jones, the Giants used the nonexclusive franchise tag on their star running back Saquon Barkley, who will make $10.091 million under the tender in the 2023 season. As the Giants' offensive engine on the ground, Barkley completed 16 carries to rush for 1,312 yards and 10 touchdowns in 16 games. It's his third 1,000+ rushing yards season since he was drafted by the team with the second pick in 2018.
