China's consumer market has maintained a gradual and steady momentum of recovery since the start of the year, China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said at a news conference on Thursday. During the Spring Festival, passenger flow volume in key business districts in 36 large- and medium-sized cities went up by 27.8 percent from the same period last year, while sales of key retailers and catering businesses increased by 6.8 percent, said Wang. "Consumption recovery" and "consumption expansion" will be the two key aspects for China's economic development in 2023, Wang said. Policies to restore consumption are mainly focused on revitalizing sectors affected by COVID-19 pandemic, boosting consumer confidence, and restoring market vitality. Measures to expand consumption will be geared toward improving consumption conditions, innovating consumption scenarios and release consumption potential, he said. The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) will put forward a series of pro-consumption campaigns for the year and cooperate with local governments to promote consumption on a regular basis, he added. According to Wang, aside from boosting consumption, the MOFCOM will implement the countryâ€™s new development strategies in a comprehensive manner, and promote the steady growth and structure of foreign trade. It will also make greater efforts to attract and utilize foreign investment, promote the high-level opening-up to the outside world while effectively improve proper and quality growth of the country.
