China's data storage industry has leaped from technology dependence to independent innovation, said Feng Dan, deputy to China's 14th National People's Congress (NPC) and professor at the School of Computer Science at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, during the Deputies' Corridor on Sunday. Devoting themselves to developing data storage systems over the past two decades, Feng and her team have promoted the localization of data storage devices while continuing to carry out core technology research. Feng said the market share of domestic data storage systems has grown from less than 5 percent to more than 60 percent in China. The storage medium chips that make up the storage system are still relatively weak, she said, adding her team is developing next-generation memory that is faster and consumes less power, aiming to "fundamentally solve the stuck-neck problems of domestic chips." Deputy on promoting traditional Chinese culture Yang Chaoming, a deputy to the 14th NPC and professor at the Advanced Institute of Confucian Studies at Shandong University, said he witnessed the inheritance and development of outstanding traditional Chinese culture while working and living in Qufu, the hometown of Confucius, and actively participated in promoting the culture to make the world feel its unique charm. Recalling that he was once asked what he thinks is the most influential view of Confucianism to the world, Yang said he answered that it is the concept of pursuing harmony and seeking common ground. "Pursuing harmony and developing and progressing in harmony" reflects an international view of all nations should live in harmony, Yang said. The Deputies' Corridor was held before the start of the fifth plenary meeting of the first session of the 14th NPC at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
