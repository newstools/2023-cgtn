The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China report proposed pursuing a proactive national strategy in response to China's aging population, involving better elderly care programs and services and better services for elderly people who live alone. Doing so will help ensure that basic care is accessible to the entire elderly population. The Fuzhou Social Welfare Institute is a welfare institution fully financed by the Fuzhou Civil Affairs Bureau. It has developed integrated medical, nursing, comfort and care services, including specialized care for the elderly, medical treatment and long-term care. Gao Heming, an elderly resident at the institute, told CGTN Stringer that he and his wife regard it as their second home, and living there is like living amongst a warm and welcoming family.
