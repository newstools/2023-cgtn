China's next-generation manned carrier rocket is expected to make its debut launch in 2027. The new rocket is being developed to launch the next generation of manned spacecraft and planned lunar landers. "All the development and research work and plans are progressing smoothly now. Both the rocket and its connected booster will have a core diameter of five meters. For low-Earth orbit, payload capacity will be around 70 tonnes, but to meet the demands of manned lunar landings, it will be limited to 27 tonnes," said Rong Yi, chief designer of the Long March-2F carrier rocket at the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.
