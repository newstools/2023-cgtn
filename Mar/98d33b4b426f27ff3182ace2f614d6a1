Greece's newly-appointed transport minister said he was taking over on Thursday with a mandate to investigate the country's deadliest train crash, to modernize an ailing railway system and to restore safety in train travel. The government has faced harsh criticism for the state of its railway system since an intercity train collided head-on with a cargo train on Tuesday night, killing at least 46 people, many of them students in their 20s, and injuring dozens. The station master on duty has "confessed" his responsibility over the accident, the government spokesperson said Thursday. "I believe the responsibility, the negligence, the error has been confessed by the station master," Yiannis Economou told reporters. Rescuers were still combing through charred and buckled rail carriages for more victims on Thursday. (With input from agencies)
