NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg convened representatives from the governments of Türkiye, Finland and Sweden on Thursday. This was the third such meeting of the Permanent Joint Mechanism since its creation last year. The three countries agreed on the long-term value of the Ｍechanism in fighting terrorism, and agreed to continue cooperation in this format and meet again before the Vilnius Summit, according to a NATO statement. The parties agreed that rapid ratifications for both Finland and Sweden would be in everyone's interest, and that their membership will strengthen the Alliance, the statement said.
