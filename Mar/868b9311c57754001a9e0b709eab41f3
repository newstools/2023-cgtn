The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a high-quality public good initiated by China and jointly built by all partners, whose benefits are shared by the world, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said Tuesday. He said the BRI has created some 420,000 jobs in countries along the routes and helped lift nearly 40 million people out of poverty over the past decade. The BRI has attracted the participation of over three-fourths of the countries in the world and 32 international organizations. On so-called debt trap "China should be the last one to be accused of the so-called debt trap," Qin said. "China has been making efforts to help the countries in distress, and is the biggest contributor to the G20's Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI)," he said. He added that China will continue to participate constructively in the resolution of international debt issues and called on other parties to act together and share the burden fairly. "When parties sit together and talk things through, there will be more solutions than problems." He made the remarks at a press conference held on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress in Beijing.
