Cyclone Freddy pummeled Mozambique on Saturday, killing one person, ripping roofs off houses and triggering a lockdown in one port town, local media have reported, two weeks after 27 died when the storm first made landfall. Satellite data showed that Freddy, one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, swept ashore around 10:00 p.m. local time, after battering the southern African coast with rain for hours.
