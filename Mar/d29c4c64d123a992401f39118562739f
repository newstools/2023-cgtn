The death toll of a recent migrant shipwreck near the southern Italian coast has risen to 67, Italian authorities said on Wednesday. Provincial government officials said rescuers had found two more children, bringing the minor victims of Sunday's tragedy to 16. The vessel, which authorities believe was carrying up to 200 migrants, had set sail from TÃ¼rkiye and sank in rough seas before dawn on Sunday near Steccato di Cutro, a seaside resort on the eastern coast of Calabria.
