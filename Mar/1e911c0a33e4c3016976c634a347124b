Meanwhile, Li said he had room for improvement after the game against Hong Kong's top player Ng, who is ranked world No. 15. "My opponent was very tenacious, while I had ups and downs psychologically, especially I was not patient enough in long rallies. I was also not bold, firm and decisive enough in the last several points." The young player went on to say "I had never won over Ng before, and there is gap between us. I had opportunities today, so I feel pity for the result."
