"In many areas of Tibet, women are dependent on their husbands to earn a living while they take care of the children. However, from my own experience, I believe that it is important for women to learn to support themselves and pave their own path in life." Wangtso, co-founder of the "Nagqu Herding Women's Joint Venture Company", was born in the city of Nagqu, 4,500 meters above sea level. Throughout her life, she has faced many challenges. As a single mother of three, at one time she had to sell scrap to feed her children. Later, it was only by learning to do business that she was able to pay her daughter's medical bills. Having never been to school and nor speaking Mandarin, Wangtso struggled to communicate. But her persistence and hard work eventually paid off, and now she not only makes a good living for her family, but is also able to help others. Most of the employees at her company are women from disadvantaged families â€“ many of who single mothers like herself. She has shown how women, by controlling their own fate, can bring about positive change for themselves and those around them.
