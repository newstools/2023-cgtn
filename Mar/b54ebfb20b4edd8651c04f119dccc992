China has set a GDP growth target of around 5 percent for 2023, Premier Li Keqiang said in the government work report. Nobel laureate in economics Michael Spence told CGTN in an interview that China's reopening is an "enormous positive" for the global economy and it lowers supply constraints that have contributed to inflation in the global economy. He also expects Chinese economic growth to accelerate reasonably quickly so that the world will have a good year and probably an even better year next year.
