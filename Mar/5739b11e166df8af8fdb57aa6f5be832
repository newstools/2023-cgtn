Kang Yi, director of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), is confident that China's overall economic operation will improve this year and the expected growth target of around 5 percent will be attained. He made the remarks during an interview after the fifth plenary meeting of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing on Sunday. This confidence comes from the judgment of the fundamentals of economic development and the observation of the economic operation situation since the start of the year, said Kang. China is still the largest developing country in the world in the medium and long term, with vast space for development, he said, adding that the market expectation has improved significantly this year. China's economic achievements were "extremely hard-won" in 2022 in face of impact from external geopolitical conflicts, the COVID-19 pandemic, and natural disasters of heat and drought. The country has demonstrated strong economic resilience which laid a foundation for future work. He also noted statistical fraud occurring in some places and vowed zero tolerance for such behavior. "China will launch a special campaign against statistical fraud this year to ensure the authenticity of statistical data," said Kang. A survey on input and output will be carried out simultaneously as China proceeds with the fifth national economic census this year, he added.
