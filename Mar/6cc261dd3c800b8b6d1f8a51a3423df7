China secured victory in the critical battle against poverty within the set timeframe and has worked to consolidate and build on achievements in poverty alleviation, according to a government work report submitted to the national legislature for deliberation on Sunday. The country has worked both to consolidate achievements in poverty alleviation and promote the revitalization of rural areas over the past five years, said the report. Following the elimination of absolute poverty, major poverty relief policies remained largely unchanged during the transition period, it added. "We established effective monitoring and assistance mechanisms to prevent people lifted out of poverty from relapsing into poverty and took robust actions in response to natural disasters and COVID-19 to forestall any large-scale relapse into poverty," it said.
