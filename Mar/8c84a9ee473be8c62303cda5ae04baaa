The Arizona Diamondbacks have reached an eight-year, $111 million contract extension with their outfielder Corbin Carroll, according to The Athletic on Saturday. Carroll, 22, became the youngest drafted player in the MLB history to sign a nine-figure deal. The Diamondbacks can keep him until 2030 with the new contract, which also includes a ninth-year option and performance bonuses. If they are all exercised and triggered, the deal can max out at $154 million. Having been drafted by the Diamondbacks with the 16th pick in 2019, Carroll made his major league debut in August 2022. He hit a batting average of .260, an on-base percentage of .330 and a slugging percentage of .500 with 27 home runs and 104 at-bats in 32 games. Keith Law of The Athletic ranked Carroll as his No. 1 prospect for the 2023 MLB season. "The Diamondbacks are building a tremendous core of young players, and Carroll will be one of their centerpieces for a long time," Law wrote. It's very rare for the Diamondbacks or any team to sign such a long, big contract with a young player like Carroll, who is still an eligible competitor for Rookie of the Year in the new season. Julio Rodriguez signed a 12-year, $209.3 million extension with the Seattle Mariners last year; Wander Franco inked a 11-year, $182 million deal with the Tampa Bay Rays in 2021; but both played longer in the MLB than Carroll when they were offered the big contracts. The Diamondbacks only gave nine-figure guarantee money to one player before, which was the six-year, $206.5 million deal to pitcher Zack Greinke in 2015. By doing it again to Carroll, the team showed how much importance they attached to the 22-year-old youngster. It has been five years since the Diamondbacks appeared in the MLB playoffs. They won only 74 of the 162 regular season games in 2022.
