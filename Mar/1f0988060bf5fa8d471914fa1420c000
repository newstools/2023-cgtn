China's supreme court delivered its annual report on Tuesday during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress in Beijing, illustrating the work over the past five years and prioritizing the tasks they will carry out in 2023. From 2018 to 2022, the Supreme People's Court concluded nearly 145,000 cases, while local courts at all levels concluded around 140 million cases, according to the report. The number of serious violent crimes handled over the past five years was around 238,000 cases. Criminal cases and serious violent crimes have steadily decreased, and the people's sense of security has significantly increased, the report noted. Chinese courts will unswervingly counter illegal sanctions and "long-arm jurisdictions" to firmly safeguard China's judicial sovereignty and people's interests, the report said.
