China has effectively curbed serious violent crimes and crimes related to guns, explosives and drugs over the past five years, Zhang Jun, procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said in a work report at the second plenary meeting of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on Tuesday. A total of 814,000 people were prosecuted over such crimes during the period, a drop of 31.7 percent from the previous five years, said the report submitted Tuesday to the ongoing national legislature session for deliberation. China has increasingly used public interest litigation to protect the natural environment, according to the report. Over the past five years, China's procuratorial authorities have handled 395,000 public interest lawsuits regarding the protection of ecology and natural resources, with an average annual rise of 12.5 percent, said the report. The report also mentioned that China's procuratorial authorities will fully leverage the rule of law to facilitate high-quality development in 2023.
