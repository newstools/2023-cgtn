PetroChina announced on Friday that it has completed drilling a well at a depth of 9,396 meters in Tarim Basin, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, making it the deepest horizontal well in Asia. It marks the Tarim Oilfield entering a new phase of oil and gas exploration at a depth of 9,000 meters, said the country's largest oil and gas producer. The well, Guole 3C, is located in the Fuman oilfield, China's largest ultra-deep oilfield. The breakthrough was achieved by adopting several core technologies and equipment, including the self-developed 9,000-meter ultra-deep electric drilling rig. The Fuman oilfield, which boasts more than 1 billion tonnes of oil and gas resources, is expected to produce 5 million tonnes of oil and gas equivalent annually by 2025, according to PetroChina. The oilfield is one of the 32 oil and gas fields of PetroChina's Tarim Oilfield, with which ultra-deep oil and gas resources account for over 80 percent of the country's total. According to the Guinness World Records, the world's longest drilled oil well is BD-04-A, located in the Al-Shaheen offshore oil field off the coast of Qatar. With a total length of 12,290 meters, the well includes a horizontal section measuring 10,900 meters.
