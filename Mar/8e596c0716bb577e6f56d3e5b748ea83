The NFL teams didn't wait long to reach deals with unrestricted free agents since the two sides were allowed to begin negotiations on Monday. Quarterback (QB) Jimmy Garoppolo will join the Las Vegas Raiders on a three-year, $67.5 million contract, including $34 million guaranteed, according to ESPN. As the 62nd selection by the New England Patriots in the NFL Draft in 2014, Garoppolo spent the first three seasons playing backup to Tom Brady before he was traded to the San Francisco 49ers in 2017. He became the 49ers' regular starting QB in the 2019 season and led the team to Super Bowl LIV, which they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs. Garoppolo only played two complete seasons in the 49ers because of injuries. He became a free agent after the 2022 season. The Raiders released their long-time starting QB Derek Carr during the offseason. Garoppolo will join coach Josh McDaniels, who was the Patriots' offensive coordinator during the three years Garoppolo was there. The 49ers have reached a four-year, $84 million deal with defensive tackle Javon Hargrave, including $40 million guaranteed, according to ESPN. Hargrave finished his third season with the Philadelphia in 2022. He had a career-high 11 sacks, 16 quarterback hits, 10 tackles for loss and two fumble recoveries for the team that led the National Football Conference (NFC) with 14 wins and reached Super Bowl LVII. The Chiefs reached a four-year, $80 million contract with offensive tackle Jawaan Taylor, including $60 million guaranteed, according to ESPN. Taylor has started in each of his 66 games for the Jacksonville Jaguars, which drafted him with the 35th pick in 2019. He made remarkable progress last season, rising from 56th in pass block win rate among offensive tackles (84.5 percent) from 2021 to 37th (88.8 percent) last season. He also gave up only seven sacks in 2022, 33 fewer than in the previous campaign. The Chiefs landed Taylor in case they lose their starting left tackle, Orlando Brown Jr, who is also an unrestricted free agent. The Atlanta Falcons reached a four-year, $64 million deal with safety Jessie Bates III, who will make $23 million in the first year and $36 million in the first two years overall, according to ESPN. In his fifth season with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2022, Bates posted a career-high four interceptions and contributed eight pass deflections. He also led the NFL in opposing completion percentage and limited the opponents' QBs to the third-lowest total quarterback rating, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The Denver Broncos reached a five-year, $87.5 million contract with offensive tackle Mike McGlinchey, with $50 million guaranteed, according to ESPN. McGlinchey started in all 17 games for the 49ers last season, posted the second-best pass block win rate (89.6 percent) of his career and reached a career-high in run block win rate (81.3 percent), which was the fifth-best among tackles in the league last season. The Chicago Bears reached a four-year, $72 million contract with linebacker Tremaine Edmunds with $50 million guaranteed, according to ESPN. No inside linebacker has received a bigger four-year deal in league history. Having played five seasons in the Buffalo Bills, Edmunds could produce over 100 tackles in every season. He has five interceptions, 35 passes defended, 2 forced fumbles and 6.5 sacks for his career. Though Edmunds missed four games last season due to injuries, the Bills' head coach Sean McDermott said he played "his best year" in 2022.
