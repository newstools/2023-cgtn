China's largest oil refiner Sinopec announced on Tuesday that it has achieved a depth of 8,937.77 meters in an oil drilling exploration, making it the deepest vertical well with a daily production capacity of 1,000 tonnes in Asia. Located in the Tarim Basin, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,Â Shunbei No. 84 inclined well had the capacity to produce 496.4 tonnes of crude oil and 653,000 cubic meters of natural gas per day during the testing process, which is equivalent to 1,017 tonnes of oil, said the company. As the 22nd well with daily output surpassing 1,000 tonnes in Sinopec's Shunbei oil and gas field, the well is Asia's deepest of its kind, according to Cao Zicheng, deputy chief geologist of Sinopec Northwest Oil Field Company. To date, the oil and gas field has commissioned 49 ultra-deep drilling wells with a depth exceeding 8,000 meters.
