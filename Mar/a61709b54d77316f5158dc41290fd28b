The Shenzhou-15 crew has completed their second extravehicular activity, according to the China Manned Space Agency on Thursday. Team members Fei Junlong and Zhang Lu have successfully completed all the tasks for the second spacewalk and returned to the space station with the help of the ground team and teammate Deng Qingming, who was inside the space station during the spacewalk. The Shenzhou-15 crew has completed several tasks in the space station, such as installing and testing multiple science experiment cabinets and moving cargo around out of the space station. The cabinet for combustion science has carried out its first ignition test, which proved it's ready for the following science projects. The crew successfully obtained the three-dimensional structural images of their skin cells with the country's self-developed two-photon microscope early this week, which provides new tools to check taikonauts' health in orbit. The Shenzhou-15 crew is expected to conduct a slew of science and technology experiments and more spacewalks.
