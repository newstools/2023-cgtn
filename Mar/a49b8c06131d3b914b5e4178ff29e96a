Bayern Munich eliminated Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) from the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday with their eighth straight win in the tournament. The Bundesliga giants allowed no goal in seven of those games. PSG performed in completely different ways in the first and second halves of Wednesday's competition. Instead of making adjustments for the club to win, their manager Christophe Galtier's decision of sending El Chadaille Bitshiabu to the field cost them this game. As one of the biggest-spending clubs in Europe, PSG have reached the Champions League final only once in the past decade. No matter which and how many stars they have signed, they still couldn't make a difference. Now that PSG are going nowhere in extension negotiations with Lionel Messi, not to mention there are again rumors about the club willing to sell Neymar, the French powerhouse is likely looking at the end of an era.
