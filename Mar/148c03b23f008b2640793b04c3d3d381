As the spring thunder cracks the sky and is believed to startle the hibernating insects in traditional Chinese folklore, Jingzhe, or “the Awakening of Insects,” started on Monday this year. At this time of year, the weather warms up in various parts of China, along with a noticeable rise in precipitation and sunlight, providing ideal farming conditions. As an old Chinese saying goes, “Once ‘the Awakening of Insects’ arrives, spring plowing never rests.” For farmers, Jingzhe sounds the horn for another busy plowing season, if not the busiest time of the year. The arrival of this third solar term of the year, as its name indicates, marks an increase in insect activity. Though instead of a trembling thunderclap, it is the rise in temperature that serves as a “morning call” to wake those insects from their winter slumber and bring the earth back to life. “The Awakening of Insects” has also given rise to various customs, with eating pears ranking among the most popular. One theory holds that this sweet and juicy fruit is beneficial in clearing the body’s internal heat and moistening the lungs, while also soothing parched mouths, dry tongues and sore throats brought on by the rapid rise in temperatures. Another theory has it that as the Chinese word for “pear” (li) is homophonic with the character meaning “to leave,” eating pears during this solar term can help drive away pests from crops and ensure a good harvest throughout the year. In some regions like Jiangsu and Shanxi, it is said that eating pears at this time can keep you in good health and good spirits all year round. In Guangdong and Hong Kong, another curious folk ritual known as “Villain Hitting” has been preserved by generations of local residents. In hope of expelling the “bad egg” and bringing good luck, the ceremony often involves using shoes or other tools to hit human-shaped paper cuttings representing these ne’er-do-wells and troublemakers.
