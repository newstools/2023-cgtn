The Colombian government and guerrilla group the National Liberation Army (ELN) said on Friday they had agreed to begin negotiating a ceasefire, as the two sides wrapped up a second round of peace talks in Mexico. The goal is to reach an accord based on international humanitarian law, according to an agreement read by a member of the government delegation in the presence of both parties. "We took the first steps to firm up a bilateral, national and temporary ceasefire which will create better conditions for Colombians' mobilization and participation in the peace process," said Pablo Beltran, head of the ELN delegation. A truce was the desire of "the entire Colombian nation," Otti Patino, head of the government delegation said. "We have heard that cry, and we feel that the ELN delegation has also heard it." The next round of talks is due to be held in Cuba, though a date has not yet been announced. Colombia has suffered more than half a century of armed conflict between the state and various groups of left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and drug traffickers. Since taking office in 2022, Gustavo Petro, Colombia's first leftist president, has proposed a "Total Peace" policy involving the country's various armed factions to end over 50 years of fighting that has victimized millions of people. The government and the ELN concluded the first cycle of talks in December 2022, with no ceasefire reached. On December 31, the government announced a ceasefire with major armed groups in the country, while the ELN said it had not agreed to it. (With input from agencies)
