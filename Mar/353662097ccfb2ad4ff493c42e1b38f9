Storms generating tornadoes and heavy rains rolled through parts of the southern U.S. on Friday, killing at least nine people and leaving over 1 million customers without power, local authorities said. The National Weather Service warned that the powerful storm is moving northeast and will dump heavy snow and sleet from southeastern Michigan to New York State. Parts of central New York and southern New England may see over 30 centimeters of snow by Saturday afternoon.
