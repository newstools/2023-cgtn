The U.S. perception and views toward China are seriously distorted, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Tuesday. Noting the United States regards China as its primary rival and the biggest geopolitical challenge, Qin said the result is that the U.S.'s China policy has entirely deviated from a rational and sound track. He made the remarks in response to questions about China-U.S. relations at a press conference on the sidelines of the first session of the 14th National People's Congress in Beijing.
