The death toll from an explosion in the commercial district of Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, rose to 19 on Wednesday, local media reported. Over 50 others were injured. The new higher death toll came after two more dead bodies were found in the basement of the Queen Tower building damaged by the explosion, local media said, citing the city's fire service. On Tuesday around 4:50 p.m. local time, a huge explosion ripped through a building in a major wholesale hub in Dhaka. The exact cause of the blast remains unclear. A four-person committee was set up on Wednesday to investigate the explosion and is required to submit a report within five working days. According to the Dhaka Tribune, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) said it found the explosion originated from the building's basement and has ruled out AC as a possible cause.
