The South Korean government formally proposed on Monday compensating over a dozen victims of Japan's wartime forced labor through a Seoul-backed public foundation instead of direct payment from responsible Japanese firms, Yonhap reported. The proposal seeks to resolve the issue of compensating 15 South Koreans who won legal battles against two Japanese companies accused of mobilizing them for hard labor during World War II.
