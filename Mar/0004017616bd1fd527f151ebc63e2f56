Michelle Yeoh made history on Sunday by becoming the first Asian to win the Best Actress Award at the 95th Academy Awards. She beat other nominees with her excellent performance in the sci-fi film “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” The 60-year-old gave an inspiring speech after receiving the award. “For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, this is the beacon of hope and possibilities. This is proof that dreams big and dreams do come true. And ladies, don’t let anybody tell you that you’re ever past your prime. Never give up!” she said. Born in Malaysia in 1962, Yeoh started her acting career in Hong Kong in the early 1980s. She rose to fame after starring in a series of action movies. After moving to the U.S. in the late 1990s, she gained global recognition for her roles in such films as “Tomorrow Never Dies,” starring opposite Pierce Brosnan as 007, and Ang Lee’s “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” In the comedy-drama “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” Yeoh plays a Chinese-American immigrant who travels through the multiverse to save her daughter. For her acclaimed performance, she also pocketed gongs at the 80th Golden Globe Awards and 2023 Screen Actors Guild Awards. In recognition of her outstanding work in the film industry and her power to inspire women and other Asian actors, Time Magazine named Yeoh its Icon of the Year 2022.
