Huang Miansong, a member of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said he brought the proposal of improving the long-term treatment of sewage in rural areas. Being the youngest member of CPPCC's newly-established environment and natural resources sector, Huang said the new sector shows the importance the country has placed in ecological civilization and that he hopes to see more young folks join the cause of environmental protection.
