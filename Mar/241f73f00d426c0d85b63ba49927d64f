Unfounded claims like 'debt trap' attempt to smear China's image, yet cannot stop the construction and continuous advancement of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Guo Weimin, spokesperson for the first session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said on Friday at a press conference. China always provides loans for project construction in accordance with the actual situation of the project host countries to avoid creating new debt risks and financial burdens, he said. The spokesperson noted that 29 countries, including China, have jointly formulated the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road. The principles guide the participant countries' governments, financial institutions and enterprises to pay attention to debt sustainability when using funds. The BRI has brought effective investment to participant countries and facilitated economic growth and improved people's livelihoods along the route, he added. Noting that this year marks the 10th anniversary since China proposed the BRI, Guo said China will strengthen infrastructure connectivity, expand new space for cooperation in green development, public health security, and digital areas, and improve the risk prevention and control system.
