Phil Foden's brace eased Manchester City to a 3-0 victory over second-tier Bristol City as they moved into the English Football Association (FA) Cup sixth round but Leicester City's hopes of repeating their 2021 triumph were dashed on Tuesday. Foden struck in the seventh minute but it was not an entirely comfortable night for Pep Guardiola's side until the England forward's deflected effort made it 2-0 late on. Kevin De Bruyne then gave the scoreline an emphatic look with a sublime finish from 25 meters although it was harsh on Bristol City who had been on a 12-match unbeaten run and pushed the Premier League champions hard. "It was really tough. Bristol showed us how good they can be. I was impressed by some players, I didn't know them. The second half was much better," Guardiola said. Leicester were booed off after a 2-1 home defeat by second-tier Blackburn Rovers for whom Tyrhys Dolan and Sammie Szmodics were on target before a Kelechi Iheanacho reply. "It's just consistency and mentality and ambition to succeed. That's been too up and down for us," Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said. "I'm really disappointed for the supporters. It's been a real challenge for them this season. The FA Cup was an opportunity to get to a quarterfinal, against a Championship team at home, but they were a lot better than us, and we have to be worried about that." Fulham reached the sixth round for the first time in 13 years with superb goals by Joao Palhinha and Manor Solomon earning them a 2-0 win over fellow top-flight side Leeds United. Brighton and Hove Albion's hopes of a first ever major trophy remained intact as Evan Ferguson's first-half goal sealed a 1-0 win over second-tier Stoke City.
