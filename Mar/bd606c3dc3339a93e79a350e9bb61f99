"Only litigation lawyers can experience the thrill of being a lawyer. I will keep going." Dekyi Palmo, a lawyer fluent in Mandarin and Tibetan, has worked on over 500 cases during the course of her six-year career. Alongside her professional work, she is actively engaged in social welfare and serves as a legal advisor for rural migrant workers. She has been heavily influenced by the intelligence and strength of the female figures in her family, especially her grandmother, who spent the first part of her life as a serf. She attributes much of her success to the wisdom and insight she gained from them, which have given her the confidence to chart her own course in life. With a unique feminine perspective and deep empathy for other women, she has developed her own observation and understanding of the status of women in the modern era.
