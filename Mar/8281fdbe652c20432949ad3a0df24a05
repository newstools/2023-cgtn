China on Tuesday expressed strong opposition to Australia, UK, and U.S. cooperating to create a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, saying they disregard the concerns of the international community and pose risks for nuclear proliferation. "This is a typical Cold War mentality, which will only stimulate an arms race, undermine the international nuclear non-proliferation system, and damage regional peace and stability," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin at a regular briefing on Tuesday. The U.S. and UK agreed to provide Australia with the technology and capability for nuclear-powered submarines as part of a three-nation, multi-decade deal that is aimed at strengthening the allies' presence in the Asia-Pacific region.
