China faces favorable conditions to stabilize employment in 2023, said Guo Weimin, spokesperson for the first session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) onÂ Friday at a press conference. "With the optimization and adjustment of COVID-19 prevention policies and further implementation of various measures to stabilize the economy, China's economy will continue to recover and provide solid support in stabilizing employment," Guo said. Pressure on employment is relatively heavy, with the number of college graduates expected to reach a record high of 11.5 million in 2023. Meanwhile, there is a gap between the skills and qualities of job seekers and their job demands. The CPPCC members have submitted a large number of proposals on stabilizing and promoting employment, Guo added. In 2022, the Committee on Economic Affairs conducted research on creating work opportunities by supporting stable development of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual businesses, while the Committee of Education, Science, Culture, Health and Sports focused on employment of college graduates. Their special reports and proposals will be an important part during consultation and deliberation, Guo said. Last August, at a meeting on employment where officials from 15 ministries and commissions were present, 11 members of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee made key speeches. "Many suggestions put forward by the CPPCC members have been adopted," Guo said. Moreover, flexible employment has played a key role in stabilizing the job market. China's flexible employment population reached 200 million as of 2021, according to data from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.
