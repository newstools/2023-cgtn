China is willing to work with Russia to safeguard peace and security and maintain development and prosperity, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Thursday during a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in New Delhi, India. China and Russia should maintain exchanges at all levels with close communication and coordination between foreign affairs departments, Qin said. The healthy and stable development of China-Russia relations has set a new paradigm of a new model of major power relations and also plays an important role in promoting solidarity and cooperation between emerging markets and developing countries, he added. Lavrov said Russia supports and will actively participate in the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, and is ready to strengthen cooperation and coordination with China in the multilateral frameworks such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS. Both sides exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis. Qin called for jointly upholding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and reiterated that China supports a political solution of the crisis and opposes sanctions and pressure. China supports all efforts conducive to promoting peace talks and will continue to play a constructive role to this end, he said. Lavrov appreciated China's constructive role and objective and impartial position on the crisis, saying that the Russian side is always open to negotiations and dialogue. The two sides also signed a 2023 consultation plan between Chinese and Russian foreign ministries.
