China's top political advisory body on Saturday called on members to consolidate and expand the patriotic united front to the greatest extent, at the opening meeting of the first session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Wang Yang, chairman of the 13th CPPCC National Committee, made the remarks as he delivered a work report of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee to the session. "We have fully leveraged the role of the CPPCC as the most inclusive patriotic united front organization, pooling strength of the Chinese people at home and abroad to realize national rejuvenation," Wang said. Over the past five years, the CPPCC National Committee had organized various communication mechanisms for different parties, receiving 1,675 proposals and 502 speeches, according to Wang. "We have invited non-party members to perform their jobs and involved people from different sectors of the society to engage in our events," Wang said. Looking forward, Wang noted that the CPPCC must "stay committed to the patriotic united front, strengthen unity and diversity, enrich the platform and strengthen consensus."
