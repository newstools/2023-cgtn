Jingzhe, or Awakening of Insects, is the third of China's 24 solar terms. It means that the warmer weather wakes up the animals hibernating in the soil. Once upon a time, insects hid in the soil in winter without drinking or eating, which is called "zhe" in Chinese, meaning hibernation. When it comes to the day of Jingzhe, thunder wakes up the hibernating animals, called "Jing," meaning "wake up in a panic". In fact, insects can not hear the thunder, animals wake up because the weather is warming up and they are ending their hibernation. Eating pear is a custom during Jingzhe. Pears can be eaten raw, steamed, juiced or boiled in water. Because the weather is dry during this time, eating pears can be hydrating and relieve a dry throat. In ancient China, when there were more kinds of creatures, some infectious diseases did not have special medicine. On the day of Jingzhe, the time when all bugs wake up, eating pears is also a way to remind everyone to be careful. In Chinese, the homophone of "pear" is "Li," which means "away from". It is said that eating pears can keep pests away from crops, which can ensure a good harvest for the whole year. Still in Chinese, "pear" and "plow" pronounce the same, which means that crops can start to be planted. The Chinese people have attached great importance to Jingzhe since ancient times, and it is considered to be the beginning of the spring farming season.
