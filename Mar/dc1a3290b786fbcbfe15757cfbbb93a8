China commenced a month-long nationwide campaign on Tuesday with a variety of activities to promote consumption. Meanwhile, the first consumption season organized by the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region was also inaugurated as a part of the campaign, aiming to build a pro-consumption platform featuring coordinated development, diversified integration and model innovation. Launch events showcasing local cuisines, culture and brands were held in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province respectively. The campaign, called "National Consumption Promotion Month," will run throughout March, while the consumption season activities in Beijing will last for the whole year, with 25 key pro-consumption events as well as coupons to be rolled out. This year, Beijing will accelerate the construction of a four-tier commercial consumption structure, which consists of an international consumption experience zone, an urban consumption center, a regional dynamic consumption circle, and a community life circle, said the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau. It added that the city will also strive to introduce about 800 "first stores" of domestic and foreign brands.
