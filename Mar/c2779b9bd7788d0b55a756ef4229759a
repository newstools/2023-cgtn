China's food security is guaranteed on the whole and China will make sure that the rice bowl of the 1.4 billion Chinese people will always be firmly held in their own hands, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said on Monday. The annual grain output in China has remained steady at over 650 million tonnes for eight years in a row, Li told a press conference. He said the country will further increase its grain production capacity by focusing on two key factors, namely arable land and seeds. Encouraging farmers to produce more grains, Li said government policies in support of grain production will only increase, not decrease.
