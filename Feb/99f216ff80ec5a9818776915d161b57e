One person died and 13 others were injured after an explosion tore through an Ohio metals plant on Monday, scattering molten metal and debris that rained down on neighboring buildings, local media ABC27 reported. Thirteen people were taken to hospital, many of them with burn wounds, and one more was being treated on site, said Oakwood Fire Department Captain Brian DiRocco. The explosion that happened at the I. Schumann & Co. metals plant in Bedford was about 112 kilometers northwest of East Palestine, Ohio, where a train loaded with toxic chemicals derailed earlier this month. Firefighters said that an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the explosion. (With input from agencies)
