The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games have reaped lasting and wide-ranging social and economic benefits for people in China, according to an article by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Wednesday. Hosting the Olympics has attracted 346 million Chinese in winter sports since 2015, said the article. The number is expected to exceed 520 million in the 2024-2025 snow and ice season, and the related tourism revenue will reach 720 billion yuan (about 107 billion U.S. dollars). The IOC also noted that the Beijing organizers minimized the impact on the environment by prioritizing using existing venues and renewable energy. In addition, the Beijing Winter Olympics created an important legacy in terms of gender equality. 45.4 percent of the athletes were women, the highest proportion of female athletes ever at a Winter Olympics event.
