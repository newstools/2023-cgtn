At least 73 migrants were reported missing and presumed dead following a shipwreck off the Libyan coast on February 14, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Libya said on Twitter on Wednesday. The boat carrying 80 people had departed Qasr Al-Akhyar, some 75 kilometers east of the capital, Tripoli, and was heading to Europe. So far, 11 bodies have been retrieved by the Libyan Red Crescent and the local police, the IOM said. Meanwhile, the UN migration agency said the "seven survivors who made it back to Libyan shores in extremely dire conditions are currently in the hospital." (With input from agencies)
