At the age of 11, China's Zhou Yizhu took a historic silver in the women's snowboard superpipe final at Winter Dew Tour in Copper Mountain, Colorado, the United States, on Saturday. "Zhou was the youngest athlete to land on a Winter Dew Tour podium. She's now the second youngest to make a Dew Tour podium: Japanese skateboarder Cocona Hiraki was 10 when she finished third in the women's skateboard park event at Dew Tour Long Beach 2019," noted the dewtour.com. Zhou delivered a backside 720 and switch backside 720 on her first run, taking a score of 89.33 points. She stunned the crowd again with a combination of a backside 900, frontside 720 and switch backside 540 on her second attempt to take 90.66. After falling on both her third and fourth run, Zhou had to settle for second place behind 14-year-old South Korean Gaon Choi, who received 98.33 points on her third run, one of the highest scores ever awarded at Dew Tour. "Oh my god, I feel so stoked," Zhou said after the competition. "These crowds made me feel more excited and I was just like, 'Let's do this, let's get it.' I just tried my best. I didn't care if I fell and now I am in second place. I am so happy and thank you to everyone who made this happen." "I feel so excited and so thankful to be here," Zhou said. "I feel like Copper Mountain is my family; they've been supporting me ever since I first came here. This pipe is amazing, and the whole entire Dew Tour crew is amazing. I'm speechless."
