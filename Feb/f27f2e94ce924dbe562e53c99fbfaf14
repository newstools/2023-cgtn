John Lee, chief executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, on Thursday announced 500,000 free air tickets for visitors to experience the "hustle and bustle of Asia's world city." Lee made the announcement at the launch ceremony of "Hello, Hong Kong," a campaign that aims to tell "good stories" about the southern Chinese city. With an array of events, including the Hong Kong Marathon, arts and cultural delights as well as top trade shows, the city is poised to boost many sectors during the next two months, the campaign said. The giveaway will open in March and mainly be distributed by local airlines Cathay Pacific, HK Express and Hong Kong Airlines. Another 80,000 tickets will be offered to residents in the summer, with the carriers yet to announce destinations. (With input from AFP)
