China is picking up speed in building the commercial onshore small modular reactor in south China's Hainan Province, with the completion of the final-layer concrete pouring into its internal structure on Saturday. Linglong One is a multi-functional modular small pressurized water reactor (PWR) developed by China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) with independent intellectual property rights. The project began construction at the Changjiang Nuclear Power Plant in Hainan on July 13, 2021. The internal structure has a diameter of 30 meters. The completion of the last concrete pouring marks the conclusion of the civil construction of the internal structure. The Linglong One construction has completed 17 out of 36 project milestones 181 days earlier than scheduled. Compared to Hualong One, a domestically designed third-generation reactor and one of the world's most advanced nuclear power reactors, Linglong One only occupies a third of the area and has a tenth of the power. Because of its small size, the project adopts modular construction to reduce costs. The integrated design has also improved the safety of the project. The main equipment of the reactor is entirely domestically developed, showing that China is at the front of the world in small modular reactor technology. Apart from generating electricity, it has a wider range of uses, such as urban heating, industrial steam supply, seawater desalination, and oil extraction. When the project is completed and put into operation, it is expected to generate 1 billion kWh of electricity each year, able to serve 526,000 households. The Linglong One project is expected to be put into operation in February 2026.
