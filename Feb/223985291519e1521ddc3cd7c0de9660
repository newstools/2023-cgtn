China's largest single-phase commercial crude oil reserve storage project has started trial production and commercial operations on Thursday in Dongying City, east China's Shandong Province, according to its operator China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the country's national oil company. Covering an area of 1.2 million square meters, the project has 50 crude oil storage tanks, each with a storage capacity of 100,000 cubic meters. It will be able to store 4.25 million tonnes of crude oil, the company added. The facility will receive offshore oil extracted from the Bohai oilfield, the country's largest oil production base, through submarine pipelines and short sea shipping. It will facilitate the storage, refinement and transport of the country's domestic offshore oil, thus replacing crude oil import in the region, said the company. The project is expected to increase by about 15 million tonnes of throughput annually for the Dongying Port, and its import and export trade value will reach 20 billion yuan (about $2.9 billion), according to CNOOC. The oil company said that the project includes an online, digital and intelligent factory, which applies technologies such as digital twin, predictive maintenance and AI video recognition.
