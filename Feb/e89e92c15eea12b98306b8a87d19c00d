China's first megawatt iron-chromium flow battery energy storage demonstration project was successfully tested in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Tuesday, and will be put into commercial use. Completed in early January, the project is composed of 34 domestically made "Ronghe 1" battery stacks and four groups of storage tanks, making it the largest of its kind in the world. Using the chemical properties of iron and chromium ions in the electrolyte, it can store 6,000 kilowatt hours of electricity for six hours. An iron-chromium flow battery is a new energy storage application technology, with high performance and low cost. It can be charged by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, and discharged during peak hours. In addition, it can help shave peak and modulate frequency for the power system, thus enhancing its flexibility.
