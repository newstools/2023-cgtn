Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, on Monday strongly urged the U.S. Congress to respect the facts, the spirit of international law and the basic principles of international relations, to immediately stop slandering and smearing China and avoid further damage to China-U.S. relations. The so-called resolution on Chinese unmanned airship passed by the U.S. Senate hyped up the "China threat" and maliciously attacked and smeared China, the committee said in a statement, noting that it is another wrong move to distort facts in an attempt to put pressure on China. As a responsible country, China strictly adheres to international law, respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, according to the statement. The unintended entry of the unmanned Chinese civilian airship into U.S. airspace was purely an isolated, unexpected incident, it said, adding the Chinese side has repeatedly briefed the U.S. and the international community on the situation and asked the U.S. side to properly handle the matter in a calm, professional and restrained manner. The statement said that the U.S. side, however, ignored China's stern position and overreacted by an excessive use of force, which seriously violated the spirit of international law and international norms. The U.S. Congress deliberately incites confrontation, exacerbates tensions, and politicizes, complicates and escalates the isolated incident, which is typical of hegemonic and bullying practice, the statement said.
