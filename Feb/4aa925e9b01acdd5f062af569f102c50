Chinese Football Association (CFA) has demanded its top-flight clubs to manage women's football as a prerequisite for their admittance to play in the new season. In a notice released on Wednesday which listed the requirements that its clubs have to meet before being admitted to the new season, the Chinese football governing body noted that it's obligatory for the Chinese Super League clubs to get involved in the management of a women's football team. "This women's team should take part in the Chinese Women's Football Super League or the second and third-tier league," the notice read. In the 2019 season, the CFA asked its top clubs to own a women's side as an admittance requirement.
