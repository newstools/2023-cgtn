Tourist numbers in northwest China's Gansu Province have seen a significant increase since the beginning of this year and especially surged during the recent Spring Festival holiday. Visitors flocked to the ancient Silk Road cities of Dunhuang and Zhangye. According to local authorities, more than 60,000 visitors traveled to Dunhuang in January, an increase of nearly 300 percent over the same period last year. Dunhuang's Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Moon Spring scenic area, as well as other cultural and historical sites, have also seen an increase in tourists arriving from every corner of China. It was a similar case in Zhangye City, Gansu Province. The Zhangye National Geopark and its Danxia landscape scenic area received 23,600 visitors in January, an increase of over 500 percent over the same period last year. As the concept of the Silk Road has gained popularity in recent years, the cultural and historical aspects of the ancient Silk Road have captured people's interest, boosting cultural tourism in Gansu. The integration of traditional culture and modern technology has also been a driving force behind the recovery of the tourism industry in the region. The Dunhuang Academy has been utilizing digital technology to bring cultural heritage to life, generating new interest in the ancient relics. The academy is exploring the use of extended reality (XR) to further enhance the visitor experience and bring the vitality of Dunhuang culture to a wider audience. The rapid rise in tourist numbers indicates robust growth of Gansu's travel industry. The growth momentum is expected to continue in the summer season.
