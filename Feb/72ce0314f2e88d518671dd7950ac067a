China's Ministry of Commerce said on Friday that foreign firms in China do not need to worry about the rules on the unreliable entities list. The ministry said in a statement that it would strictly limit the scope of the rules after adding two U.S. companies to the unreliable entities list. The ministry announced the decision to put U.S. companies Lockheed Martin Corporation and Raytheon Missiles & Defense on the list on Thursday, as the two companies have repeatedly sold arms to Taiwan despite China's strong opposition, seriously damaging China's national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity, a spokesperson for the ministry said in a statement. The spokesperson stressed the unreliable entities list is strictly limited and aimed at very few foreign entities breaking the law. The scope will not be expanded, and there is no need for foreign-invested enterprises to worry. "The Chinese government will continue to welcome foreign companies to invest and do business in China and build a market-oriented, law-based, and international business environment," the spokesperson said. The spokesperson noted that China's action is in line with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and said China continues to support the multilateral trading system represented by the WTO and promotes the healthy development of the world economy and trade.
