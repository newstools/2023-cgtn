The first round of medical supplies and rescue workers from the Red Cross Society of China arrived in Syria on Thursday, where millions of residents already reliant on humanitarian aid due to years of war, now face the devastating aftermath of Monday's earthquakes. Cai Wennan, director of disaster management in the Relief & Rescue Department under Red Cross Society of China, is among team members heading to Syria. "What we carried to Syria is based on the list the Syrian side provided, including the most needed medicines and medical supplies. The supplies we have mobilized in China could help 5,000 people in need," Cai said. Noting the batch of Chinese humanitarian aid worth 30 million yuan (around $4.4 million), Shi Hongwei, Chinese ambassador to Syria, said we will see more batches of Chinese humanitarian aid. Days have passed since two large earthquakes struck Türkiye and Syria. On top of the cold weather, the situation in Syria is complicated by a lack of medical and food supplies. More than a decade of conflict and international sanctions are making it difficult for international aid to reach the hardest-hit areas. The Red Cross Society of China has provided the Turkish Red Crescent and the Syrian Red Crescent each with $200,000 in cash as emergency humanitarian assistance since Monday's earthquakes.
