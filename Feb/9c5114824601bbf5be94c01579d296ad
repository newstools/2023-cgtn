The World Economic Forum (WEF) 2023 annual meeting was held January 16 until the 20th with the theme “Cooperation in a Fragmented World”. WEF president Børge Brende told CGTN host Tian Wei that WEF is more optimistic now on growth in China. If China's growth engine really starts to use all its turbos, that will make a big difference. Toward the Chinese Spring Festival, Mr Brende wishes every Chinese friend a happy Year of the Rabbit!
