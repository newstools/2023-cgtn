China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) announced that its residents are no longer required to wear face masks in public places starting from Wednesday, HKSAR Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday. Lee told a press briefing before an executive council meeting that the move was based on several considerations, including data showing that the epidemic situation in Hong Kong was under control, Hong Kong has built a comprehensive anti-epidemic barrier and there was no major outbreak in hospitals and schools. From Wednesday, people do not have to wear masks outdoors or indoors, or on public transport, but high-risk places, such as hospitals and care homes, can still require visitors to wear a mask, Lee said.
