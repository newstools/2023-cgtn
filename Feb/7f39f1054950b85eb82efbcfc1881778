UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday vowed support for Türkiye and Syria as new earthquakes hit early on the day. "My thoughts continue to be with the people of Türkiye and Syria as they face the impact of new earthquakes striking the region this evening," Guterres said. "UN teams on the ground are assessing the situation, and we stand ready to provide additional support as needed." A magnitude-6.4 earthquake struck southern Turkish province of Hatay, which borders Syria, at around 8:04 p.m. on Monday night, the country's disaster agency said, two weeks after two strong quakes jolted the region. It was followed by an M5.8-shock three minutes later in the Samandag district of Hatay, the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority added. Turkish media TRT Haber TV said six people were killed due to the new quakes and 294 were taken to hospital, while Syria TV said five people were killed in the country. Earlier, Syria's rebel-held areas reported more than 190 people were injured.
