China's new photovoltaic (PV) installation has been surging as demand for PV products has increased in recent years. Experts said that a new record is expected to be set this year. A PV cell factory in Xixian New Area of northwest China's Shaanxi Province goes full throttle on its production. New manufacturing equipment is tested and workers are hired to help improve the production capacity. The new area for a PV production expansion project has a total investment of 45.2 billion yuan (around 6.73 billion U.S. dollars). After completion, it is expected to produce 100 GW of monocrystalline silicon wafers and 50 GW of monocrystalline cells per year.
