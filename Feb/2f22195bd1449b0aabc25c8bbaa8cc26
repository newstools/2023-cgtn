China's Zhang Kexin captured gold in the women's event of the FIS freestyle skiing halfpipe World Cup in Mammoth Mountain, the last stop of the International Ski Federation (FIS) event in the 2022-23 season, on Friday. The Crystal Globes, awarded to athletes with the highest total points from a season, went to Birk Irving of USA in the men's event and Canadian Rachel Karker in the women's. Karker finished third with 91.75 points behind Zhang with 93.5, and Zoe Atkin of Team Great Britain, 92.75. This was the fourth World Cup title for 20-year-old Zhang, who is already a two-time Olympian. She won her first ever World Cup gold in 2017 before adding two more golds to her profile in the following two years. In the men's event, Irving claimed the season-ending Crystal Globe title with two wins, the first at Copper Mountain in last December. Canadian Brendan Mackay won silver, and David Wise of USA took bronze. (With input from Xinhua)
