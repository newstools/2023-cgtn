The Chinese Ministry of Commerce on Thursday added two U.S. companies to the Unreliable Entity List over their involvement in arms sales to China's Taiwan region. In a statement, the ministry said it has decided to put Lockheed Martin Corporation and Raytheon Missiles & Defense, both U.S. defense contractors, on the list to safeguard China's national sovereignty, security and development interests. According to the statement, the companies are prohibited from engaging in China-related import or export activities and renewing investment in China. It said senior managers of the two companies will be banned from entering China, and their work permit, status of stay or residence in China will be rejected or revoked. The companies will also be fined. China introduced the Unreliable Entity List mechanism in September 2020 to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, among other purposes, in accordance with its foreign trade law and national security law.
