This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and together with China, Hungary should further strengthen the high-quality cooperation on BRI, Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said when meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Sunday. Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, conveyed cordial greetings from the Chinese leader to Orban and once again congratulated him on leading the Fidesz party to win a successive term as Hungary's prime minister. He said that although China and Hungary are different in size, they have always respected, understood and trusted each other, and their relationship has become a model for international relations. China is willing to advance friendly exchanges with Hungary in an all-around way, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation and strive to promote democracy in international relations and boost a multi-polar world. Talking about cooperation under the BRI, Wang said both sides should further advance the initiative. He praised Hungary's active support for the development of China-EU relations, which he said not only serves the interests of the Chinese and Hungarian peoples but also the fundamental and long-term interests of Europe. Orban said that Hungary firmly pursues a friendly policy towards China and attaches great importance to cooperation with China in various fields. He expressed gratefulness for China's assistance over the years, saying Chinese vaccines have saved many lives and Hungary will continue to make unremitting efforts to promote the development of China-EU relations. The two sides also had an in-depth exchange of views on Ukraine, saying when the situation gets more complex, countries should remain calm and make the correct choice that conforms to the rules of international relations and the long-term interests of Europe so that peace can be resumed in the region as early as possible.
