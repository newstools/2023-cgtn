The China Search and Rescue team has rescued a woman trapped under debris in Türkiye's quake-hit Hatay. The survivor was reportedly showing strong vital signs when she was found by the team from China who worked with members of Türkiye's fire brigade for over three hours to perform the rescue. She is the fourth survivor the Chinese team has managed to save since they began rescue operations in Turkiye. CGTN's Cen Ziyuan tells us more.
