China's first integrated production and refueling station for hydrogen produced from methanol was put into use in Dalian City, northeast China's Liaoning Province, the country's largest oil refinerÂ Sinopec said on Wednesday. The company said the station can produce 1,000 kilograms of 99.99 percent pure hydrogen every day. Considering the cost of production, storage and transportation, the cost of the station can be reduced by more than 20 percent compared with the traditional way of producing and using hydrogen, it added. Sinopec said that there is no solid waste, wastewater discharge, or tail gas pollution during the manufacturing process. The station has a simple layout and short construction period, said the oil company, adding that the main hydrogen production device covers an area of only 64 square meters, while other equipment with the same scale covers an area of over 500 square meters. Methanol is abundant in sources, low in cost, and easy to store and transport as a liquid at normal temperature and pressure. Compared with other hydrogen production methods, methanol produces hydrogen at a lower cost with low energy consumption.
