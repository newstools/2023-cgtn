Six people drowned after a tour boat capsized off the coast of the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, a spokesperson for the fire department said Monday. According to local authorities, a strong storm caused the boat carrying 14 people to sink on Sunday afternoon in Guanabara Bay, in the Atlantic Ocean. Emergency teams recovered six bodies. Another six passengers survived and two are still missing, including a three-year-old boy, said Leandro Monteiro, commander of the Rio de Janeiro Fire Department.
