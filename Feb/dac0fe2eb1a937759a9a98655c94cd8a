The United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) published an ultra-high resolution satellite image and a damage assessment for the Arslantepe Mound in Türkiye on February 10, 2023. UNITAR claimed that, based on satellite imagery, there was no visible severe damage to the areas surrounding the Arslantepe Mound. Türkiye's general directorate for cultural heritage and museums, part of the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, issued a statement saying that the Arslantepe Mound, a UNESCO-listed world heritage site, had suffered slight slippage to its mudbrick walls, but no severe damage was found in the area. Archaeological evidence indicates that humans have occupied the area since at least the 6th century BC, with large temples and palace complexes appearing at the site during the Uruk period. Arslantepe Mound was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2021. Recent reports suggest that nearly 25,000 buildings have been critically damaged as a result of the major Türkiye-Syria earthquake. The west tower in the old city of the ancient citadel of Aleppo, which is listed as a world heritage site in danger, has collapsed, and several other buildings have been badly damaged. UNESCO lamented the devastation suffered by the World Heritage site of Diyarbakır Fortress and Hevsel Gardens Cultural Landscape, a site of historical importance.
