The Republic of Korea (ROK) imposed new sanctions on four individuals and five entities linked to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s weapons programs following the DPRK's recent intercontinental ballistic missile launch, the foreign ministry said on Monday. The DPRK confirmed it fired two projectiles from a multiple rocket launcher, aiming at targets 395 kilometers and 337 kilometersÂ away, respectively. "The 600mm multiple rocket launcher mobilized in the firing... is a means of tactical nuclear weapon," capable of "paralysing" an enemy airfield, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said on Monday. Japan's Coast Guard said the DPRK launched two projectiles that could be ballistic missiles shortly after 10 p.m. GMT, and landed outside Japan's so-called exclusive economic zone, public broadcaster NHK said.
