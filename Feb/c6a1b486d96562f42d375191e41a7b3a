Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) on Friday reaffirmed the importance of science and data to guide Japan's decision on the discharge of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated wastewater. "On the matter of the planned release by the government of Japan on the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS)-treated water, forum leaders reaffirmed the importance of science and data to guide political decisions on the proposed discharge," outgoing PIF Chair and Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka said after the conclusion of the PIF special leaders' meeting. Meanwhile, incoming PIF Chair and the Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown stressed on Friday that Japan's discharge of nuclear-contaminated wastewater must be done in a safe way. He said he was pleased to travel to Japan recently as part of the PIF delegation in an effort to convey their concerns over the possible release of nuclear-contaminated wastewater. The PIF has urged Japan to delay its discharge of wastewater contaminated by the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean. The Japanese government said in January that the controversial plan to release radioactive wastewater into the Pacific will start in spring or summer. While stressing that the Pacific region is steadfast that there is no discharge until all parties verify it is safe, PIF Secretary General Henry Puna said recently that it is absolutely important for the Pacific that Japan does not go ahead with the release. He said the PIF must prevent action that will lead or mislead them toward another major nuclear contamination disaster at the hands of others. The PIF leaders' meeting was held in Fiji's third-largest city of Nadi since Thursday night, focusing on the PIF's solidarity. The meeting also discussed the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and the transition of the PIF chair from Fiji to the Cook Islands.
