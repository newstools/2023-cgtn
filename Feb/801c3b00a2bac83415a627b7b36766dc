Debris from Russia's Progress MS-21 cargo spacecraft has plunged into the non-navigable part of the Pacific Ocean, the Russian State Corporation Roscosmos said on Sunday. The Progress MS-21 cargo spacecraft undocked from the Russian segment of the International Space Station (ISS) on Saturday and entered the atmosphere on Sunday, with its unburned elements falling into the non-navigable part of the Pacific Ocean, Roscosmos said. On February 11, the spacecraft experienced a coolant leakage but posed no threat to the safety of three astronauts working on the ISS. Investigations into a pressure loss in the Progress MS-21 space cargo ship delayed the launch of the Soyuz MS-23 ship to bring back Sergey Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin and Frank Rubio, who were previously due to return to Earth on February 20. Roscosmos proposed on Saturday the launch of a ship on February 24 to bring them back to Earth. The Progress MS-21 cargo spacecraft was launched in October 2022, delivering over 2.5 tonnes of supplies to the ISS. (With input from agencies)
