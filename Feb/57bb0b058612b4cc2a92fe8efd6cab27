Chinese figure skating veteran Jin Boyang ranked fourth after the men's short program at the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships in Colorado Springs, the United States on Thursday. The Four Continents is Jin's first competition since the Beijing Winter Olympics. He suffered injuries and withdrew from ISU Grand Prix events last year. Dancing to "Seven Nation Army," 25-year-old Jin opened his program with a quad toeloop and a triple Axel. He made a little mistake in landing his triple-triple combination and scored 85.32 to rank fourth. "It's better than I expected," said Jin, a two-time world championships bronze medalist. "I was preparing for this competition as soon as I got back on the ice. The time is so tight. I have been systematically training for only about two months. I started from bad triple jumps to what happened today. I think that's a pretty fast recovery." Japan's Kao Miura took the lead with 91.90 points, while retiring Canadian star Keegan Messing ranked second in 86.70. Jimmy Ma of the United States was third with 86.64. A rising Chinese skater, Chen Yudong, 18, ranked 15th with 67.93. In the women's short program, South Korea's Kim Yelim, 20, delivered a nearly flawless dance to take the lead with 72.84. "I was so, so nervous before," she said, "but I did an almost clean program and I am happy about that." American Isabeau Levito, 15, was second with 71.50. South Korea's Kim Chaeyeon was third, followed by Americans Amber Glenn and Bradie Tennell. Four Continents continues Saturday with the pairs short program, rhythm dance and women's free skate.
