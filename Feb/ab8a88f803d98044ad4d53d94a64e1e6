Olivier Mendoo, a Cameroonian PhD student at Peking University's School of International Relations, and his Zimbabwean friend Tungamirai Eric Mupona, embark on a tour of several villages in east China's Zhejiang Province. Their aim is to learn from China's experience in rural vitalization and grassroots governance, a reference for rural economic development in Africa. "Encounters with China: High-tech Farming Investigation" follows the two young Africans as they inspect a high-tech farm in Lishui County.
