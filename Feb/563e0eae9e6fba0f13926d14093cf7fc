Second-half goals from Anthony Martial and Fred earned Manchester United a comfortable 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest on Wednesday to secure a 5-0 aggregate win and a place in the English Football League (EFL) Cup final. United set up a meeting with Newcastle at Wembley on February 26. "The first half wasn't great to be honest," Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag told Sky Sports. "I thought it was professional but too slow and we didn't create too many chances. "The second half was much better; more tempo and we made some good goals. We just want to improve every day. I think we have a good squad so we have to demand and control the high standards." Three managers have left the club since United last won a trophy under Jose Mourinho in 2017. But Ten Hag is now just one game away from ending that drought in his first season in charge. "I think we have a good squad so we have to demand and control the high standards," said the Dutchman. "You have to bring that every game. "We are Manchester United. When you are a United player, you have to match the standards." "This club must always aim to be chasing honors," he added. United have now reached the League Cup final for the 10th time, with only Liverpool playing in more, with the club chasing their first trophy since 2017. "Congrats to United and Newcastle, good luck to them in the final," Forest manager Steve Cooper said. "Overall, we are disappointed, of course, but in terms of getting to the final the damage was done last week." (With input from agencies)
