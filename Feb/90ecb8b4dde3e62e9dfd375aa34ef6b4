A charter plane carrying essential humanitarian supplies from the Chinese government arrived in Damascus, which will be allocated and used according to the needs of the various provinces in quake-hit Syria. The aid came after the second batch of humanitarian supplies from the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC), which arrived in Syria on FebruaryÂ 13. According to the Chinese Embassy in Syria, among the 80-tonne supplies, there are around 30,000 first-aid kits, 10,000 cotton-padded jackets, 300 padded tents, 20,000 blankets and a host of emergency medical equipment such as ventilators, anesthesia machines, oxygen generators and LED surgical lights. Like the previous two batches from the RCSC, this batch of supplies will be received and managed by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.
