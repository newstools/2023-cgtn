China started developing new meteorological satellites of the Fengyun-3 (FY-3) series, according to China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) on Tuesday. Thanks to 50 years of endeavor, China has launched 19 satellites of the Fengyun family, which fall into four types and two generations, the CASC said. The FY-3 series marks the second-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellites, with substantively enhanced functionalities and technical capabilities compared to the first-generation FY-1 series. The FY-3 series is designed to enhance China's three-dimensional atmospheric sounding, meteorological data collection, and remote sensing capability. The CASC said the new FY-3 satellites, representing the final work of China's second-generation low-orbit meteorological satellites, includes a satellite for precipitation measurement in an inclined orbit and a satellite in a sun-synchronous orbit around Earth. These satellites will further improve the payload detection and platform service support capabilities and will cooperate with high-orbit meteorological satellites to realize the on-orbit verification of China's high- and low-orbit coordinated observation for the first time, which will support the development of third-generation meteorological satellites, according to the CASC. The CASC plans to complete the launch of FY-3F and FY-3G satellites and the development of another three satellites under research in 2023.
