Andy Murray of the UK saved five match points to defeat Jiri Lehecka from the Czech Republic 6-0, 3-6, 7-6(6) at the Qatar Open on Friday, setting up the final with Daniil Medvedev from Russia. Murray, 35, reached his first ATP Tour final since June. "He's a legend,‚Äù Medvedev said of Murray. "Today was just unbelievable, the way he won." Murray, the three-time Grand Slam champion who has had two hip operations, fought back from a 5-3 deficit in the deciding set. He saved two match points on his own serve and three more when Lehecka served for the match. "That was one of the most amazing turnarounds I've had in my career," Murray said in his on-court interview. "I have no idea how I managed to turn that one around to be honest." Meanwhile, Medvedev beat second-seeded Felix Auger-Aliassime from Canada for the second time in two weeks, this time 6-4, 7-6 (7). Medvedev also won in straight sets last week in the Rotterdam quarterfinals. "Confidence matters, because (Auger-Aliassime) had (three) set points," Medvedev said. "I managed to just stay in there and it was enough to win." (With input from AP) (Cover: Andy Murray in action during the Qatar Open men's singles semifinal in Doha, Qatar, February 24, 2023. /CFP)
