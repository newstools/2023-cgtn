U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit China on Sunday to meet his counterpart Qin Gang. According to the U.S. Department of State, Blinken wants to discuss a range of issues, including how to manage competition, strengthen cooperation as well as Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula. But experts say the Taiwan question and economic cooperation between China and the United States will be the most important topics on the agenda.
