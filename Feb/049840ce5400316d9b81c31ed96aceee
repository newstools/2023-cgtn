Team China took two gold medals and one silver at the Thailand Master Badminton 2023 on Sunday. In the mixed doubles final, Chinese duo Feng Yanzhe and Huang Dongping outclassed South Korean pair Seo Seung-jae and Chae Yu-jung 2-1 to extend their winning streak to 10 matches. The two pair met once before at last year's Australian Open, in which the Chinese duo lost 0-2. This was the second World Tour title for the Chinese pair in 2023, after they won the Indonesia Masters Super 500 title in Jakarta last week. In the women's singles final, Zhang Yiman came back from one set down to beat compatriot Han Yue 2-1. This was Zhang's first title since 2019, when she won the Vietnam Open Super 100.
