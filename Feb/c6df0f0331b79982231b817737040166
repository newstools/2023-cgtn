The unintended entry of the China's civilian unmanned airship is an entirely unexpected, isolated incident caused by force majeure, Xu Xueyuan, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the U.S., said on Tuesday. He lodged the solemn representations, upon instruction, to senior officials of the U.S. Department of State and White House National Security Council over U.S. shooting down of a Chinese civilian unmanned airship. After verification, the Chinese side has informed the U.S. side of this multiple times and asked that the U.S. side handle such incidents in a calm, professional and restrained manner, Xu said, according to a statement issued by the Embassy of China in the United States. Expressing China's firm opposition, Xu urged the U.S. not to take any actions that may escalate and complicate the situation, adding that China reserves the right to make a further response if necessary.
