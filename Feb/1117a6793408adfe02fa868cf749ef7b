On February 19, five people including a young girl were shot, during the Krewe of Bacchus parade in New Orleans. At least ten mass shootings claimed 50 victims during the February 17-19 weekend – America's deadliest thus far in 2023. These incidents all come in the wake of several high-profile mass shootings in California last month and an attack at Michigan State University last week.
