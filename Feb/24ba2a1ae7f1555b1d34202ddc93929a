Beijing and Hebei Province will work together to host a series of events to celebrate the first anniversary of the 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games on February 4, the Information Office of the Beijing Municipality said at the press conference on Wednesday. The 2022 Winter Olympics ran from February 4 to 20, 2022, ahead of the Winter Paralympics staged from March 4 to 13. Both events were held in downtown Beijing, Yanqing District and Zhangjiakou in Hebei Province. Beijing was the first city in history to host both the Summer Olympics (in 2008) and the Winter Olympics (in 2022). The celebration will see some 100 events and activities taking place between February 4 and mid-March, including a launch ceremony at the Shougang Ice Hockey Arena in Beijing on Saturday night, an exhibition titled "Glorious Winter Games," sports activities for public participation and an Olympic culture fair. Saturday's launch will consist of three segments, with the final section dubbed "Together for a Shared Future" after the theme song for the 2022 Winter Olympics. The ceremony is expected to promote reusing the Winter Olympic venues and showcase cultural and artistic performances. Beijing will hold eight winter sports competitions for the public as part of the anniversary celebrations, including an ice hockey challenge tournament for teenagers, a curling contest, skiing events, winter jogging and winter cycling. There will also be winter carnivals in the Olympic Forest Park and the Shichahai scenic area in Beijing. People can visit the two spots to attend exciting events like dragon boat races on ice, football on ice, and ice hockey shoot-outs, among others.
