The Global Security Initiative (GSI)  concept paper will play an important role in maintaining regional peace and promoting national security from both theoretical and practical levels, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Tuesday. He said the GSI strengthens the concept of leadership and builds international consensus. Currently the international community is faced with the question of what kind of security concept the world needs and how countries can achieve common security of the times. Adhering to a common, integrated, cooperative and sustainable view of security, the GSI advocates a new security path of talks rather than confrontation, partnership rather than alliance, and win-win rather than zero-sum, providing a relevant answer to the question of the times, the spokesperson continued. Besides, the GSI provides practical guidance and indicates the direction of action, not only establishing the principles of understanding to fix the deficit in global security, but also providing methodological paths, such as calling for the resolution of disputes between countries by dialogue and consultation, and emphasizing the integrated maintenance of security in traditional and non-traditional areas, he added. Wang also said that in response to the most prominent security concerns of the current international community, China also proposed 20 key directions for cooperation and made suggestions around cooperation platforms and mechanisms when releasing the GSI on Tuesday. It is believed that with the active participation of increasing numbers of peace-loving countries and international organizations, the GSI will accelerate its implementation, injecting new momentum to eliminate the root causes of international conflicts and address national security challenges, Wang reiterated. Since released, the GSI has been appreciated and supported by over 80 countries and international organizations, the spokesperson added.
