CGTN's Zhu Zhu spoke to Meltem Gürkan, who was stuck in the earthquake area in Kadıköy, but has since reached Istanbul. She said though companies are providing affordable packages to ensure that grocery prices remain stable, people in the epicenter are finding it difficult to procure them. She added that the public can also make donations for quake victims through government and health organizations such as AKUT and Ahbap.
