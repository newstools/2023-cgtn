China's centrally administered state-owned enterprises (SOEs) should expand effective investment and improve their investment layouts in 2023, according to a recent circular issued by the country's top state-asset regulator. Central SOEs should focus on critical areas such as major national projects, infrastructure, and strengthening and supplementing industrial chains, said the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. Additionally, the circular recommended promoting central SOEs' investment in cultivating strategic emerging industries and upgrading traditional sectors while strengthening energy and resource security and fostering a virtuous cycle between science and technology, industries and finance. The circular also emphasized the need for central SOEs to increase risk management and control in critical areas when making investments and adhere to the bottom line against significant risks. A relevant policy mix is in the works, said the commission.
