Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James has now scored more points than any NBA player in history. He passed fellow Los Angeles Laker Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's career 38,387 points during the second half of an NBA basketball game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday. Play was stopped to recognize the achievement and to let James address the crowd. "I just want to say thank you to the Laker faithful, you guys are one of a kind," James said. "To be able to be in the presence of such a legend as Kareem is unbelievable, it's very humbling. Please give a standing ovation to 'The Captain'." With a stepback jump shot with just 10.9 seconds left in the third quarter of the game, James pushed his career total to 38,388 points and broke the record, which was thought that would last forever, with very few even coming close. Karl Malone retired 1,459 points behind Abdul-Jabbar, Kobe Bryant was 4,744 points shy, and Michael Jordan was 6,095 points away. The 38-year-old needed 36 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar's tally, finished with 38 points in the Lakers's 133-130 loss. The NBA's new scoring king now has 38,390 points and is expected to keep the record for a long time, as no active player is within 10,000 points of him, who is under contract for two more years and is on pace to become the league's first 40,000-point scorer sometime next season. James is the only member of the NBA's triple-quintuple club: at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 10,000 assists. There are 44 players to reach five digits in two of those categories.
