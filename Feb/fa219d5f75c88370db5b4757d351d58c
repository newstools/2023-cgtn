China's top securities watchdog and related departments have revised the regulations on secret protection and archive management in the overseas listing for domestic companies. The revision is to match new regulations on the filing-based management of the overseas offering and listing of securities by Chinese companies published by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) last week. The new rules will come into force on March 31 this year, the commission noted. The revision has made adjustments to the application range of the regulation, clarified the direction for secret protection and archive management in the overseas listing, and enhanced cooperation in cross-border oversight, the CSRC said. The commission added that it will continue to push forward high-level institutional opening-up of the capital market, expand oversight cooperation, and create a favorable environment for the lawful overseas listing of Chinese companies.
