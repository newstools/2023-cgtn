Colombia's government and the guerrilla group National Liberation Army (ELN) resumed peace talks in Mexico City on Monday after a temporary halt caused by a misunderstanding over a mooted ceasefire. Leaders of the negotiations on both sides said the talks would focus on a bilateral ceasefire and agreements to get humanitarian aid to areas of Colombia most affected by the conflict. "Agreements are to be fulfilled... we have to produce results," said Otty Patino, head of the Colombian government delegation.
