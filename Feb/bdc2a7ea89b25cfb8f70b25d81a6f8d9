At least 23 people have died in hundreds of forest fires that have broken out in south-central Chile. The government has extended an emergency order to multiple regions, but a blistering heatwave has complicated control efforts. Officials said the fires have destroyed at least 88 homes and have swept through 47,000 hectares of forest.
