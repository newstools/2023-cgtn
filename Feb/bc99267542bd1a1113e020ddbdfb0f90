Liverpool completed a difficult week with a frustrating 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace on Saturday that did little to enhance their prospects of finishing in the top four of the Premier League. Thrashed 5-2 at home by Real Madrid in their Champions League last 16 tie on Tuesday, Jurgen Klopp's inconsistent side laboured against a Palace team that kept a first clean sheet against Liverpool for 18 years. The Reds moved up a place to seventh, six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur with a game in hand. Without a win in eight league games, Palace are 12th, six points above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Erling Haaland set a Manchester City goal record as they thrashed Bournemouth 4-1 to keep the pressure on leaders Arsenal. Haaland scored his 27th goal in 24 league appearances, establishing a new single-season City record in the competition as he moved past Sergio Aguero's total of 26 in 2014-15. Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli scored a fine goal to earn a 1-0 win at Leicester City, giving them a five-point lead at the top of the table. Elsewhere in Europe, Real Madrid's young striker Alvaro Rodriguez earned a late 1-1 draw for the champions in a tense derby clash against 10-man Atletico Madrid in Spain's La Liga.
