Jimmy Carter, the 98-year-old former U.S. president, will begin receiving hospice care at his home in Georgia, according to a statement from The Carter Center on Saturday. "After a series of short hospital stays, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter today decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention. He has the full support of his family and his medical team," the statement said.
