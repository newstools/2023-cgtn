Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.6 percent in an annualized base in the fourth quarter of 2022, government data showed on Tuesday, bouncing back from the previous quarter's contraction as the return of inbound tourists offset a slowdown in capital expenditure and exports. But the figure, rebounding from a revised 1 percent contraction in July-September, has fallen short of forecasts from Reuters and Bloomberg. And according to preliminary data released by the Cabinet Office, growth of Japan's economy, the world's third largest, slowed to 1.1 percent in 2022 over 2.1 percent in 2021.
