A five-year-old girl and her younger brother are being cared for at a Syrian hospital after surviving the catastrophic earthquake earlier the week. Jinan al-Sirri and her 11-month-old brother, Abdo, lost their parents and other siblings when the building they were in collapsed in Monday's quake. They were trapped under the rubble for two days before being rescued, and both suffered injuries. The children's uncle and grandfather have stepped in to take care of them.
