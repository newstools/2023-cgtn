Israeli airlines will resume direct flights to Türkiye as an indication of the continued improvement in bilateral relations, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said on Tuesday, predicting a 25% increase in tourism this year. The first such flight will depart on Thursday, Cohen told reporters during what he described as a solidarity visit to Türkiye, which credited Israel for sending relief delegations after last week's earthquake.
