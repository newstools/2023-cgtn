As pandemic restrictions ease around the world, many performers have dusted off their dancing shoes as theaters open their doors once again. In Beijing, the creative scene is witnessing a rapid recovery. Major theater groups in the city have resumed work, bringing once-shut venues back to life. The return of live performances is great news for theater lovers in China's capital. Popular drama group Mahua FunAge has been staging an immersive, interactive drama titled "Burn." Performing the role A Re in the play, actor Yang Shaoze said he was very excited to take to the stage again after a long time. "I am really eager to go on stage because I love the stage. I'm so excited to see the audiences again," said Yang. "I think one of the major highlights is the live band," said Yang, "The audience members don't know each other, but they can come to the show and dance and have fun together." Yang's excitement was echoed by the audience members who immersed themselves in the live show. "The atmosphere and everyone around me create a contagious energy. I can't help but dance with everyone," said Ying Ying, an audience member at the performance. The enthusiasm of the audience also inspired the performers. Tan Xi, one of the actresses in the show, said, "The audiences are paying a lot of attention to this play, and I know this because I've seen the box-office takings myself. We have sold out all the tickets, so I'm very happy." For theater lover Meng Meng, what she felt most can be summed up by the phrase "The joy once lost has now been re-found." "As to this production, I want to experience more dance dramas, musicals and movies. I want to make the most of it all during Spring Festival," said Meng Meng. MaHua FunAge's unique immersive show has reignited the enthusiasm of Beijing audiences. The reopening of theaters and art venues has ushered in a new wave of hope, just in time for the brand-new year.
