Carlos Alcaraz marked his return to action for the first time in almost four months with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Cameron Norrie in the final of the Argentina Open on Sunday. It was a seventh career title for the 19-year-old Spaniard and his first since winning the U.S. Open in September before he went on to become the youngest-ever world No.1. A leg muscle tear at the Paris Masters in November meant he missed the start of this season, including the Australian Open, won by Novak Djokovic.  World No.2 Alcaraz took his head-to-head record over the 12th-ranked Norrie to 4-1, thanks to his 93-minute victory on Sunday. He cruised at a set and 5-3 ahead before his British rival dug deep to level at 5-5. But Alcaraz showed his mastery on clay courts had not been diminished by his long absence as he steadied himself for victory. Five of his seven titles have come on clay, and he will get the chance to quickly add another as he heads to Rio next week to defend the trophy he won last year. Alcaraz is the first Spanish player to win the title in Buenos Aires since Rafael Nadal in 2015. Sunday's win also means he was the first teenager to capture the title in the Argentine capital. Meanwhile, in another ATP final in Rotterdam, former world No.1 Daniil Medvedev captured his 16th career title with a tough three-set victory over in-form Jannik Sinner.Medvedev triumphed 5-7, 6-2, 6-2 over his Italian opponent, who had won the Montpellier tournament last weekend. The 27-year-old Russian took his career head-to-head record against Sinner to 6-0 and will return to the world top 10 on Monday.
