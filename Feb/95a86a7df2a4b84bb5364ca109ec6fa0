Train derailments have gained global attention recently after a Norfolk Southern Railway train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. Only two months into 2023, there have already been more than a dozen reported train derailments in the U.S. this year. According to the data released by the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, there were over 100,000 rail incidents from 2013 to 2022, with nearly 8,000 fatalities and 78,000 injuries. In the past decade, over 30 rail incidents happened per day in the U.S. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics records 54,539 train derailments between 1990 to 2021, an average of 1,704 per year. Norfolk Southern is now facing a slew of lawsuits over its derailed cargo train. Norfolk Southern, one of the Top 5 rail operators in the U.S., accounted for over 10,000 rail incidents as of the end of 2022, the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics data shows. Its rate of rail incidents increased in each of the last four years, according to a recent company presentation. In recent years, in the pursuit of greater profitability and efficiency, U.S. rail operators have cut their workforce, used heavier and longer trains, and even opposed regulations that would have improved rail safety. "The longer, heavier, and faster you make the trains, without any commensurate adjustment in safety protocols, the thinner your risk margins are getting," said Ian Naish, a train safety consultant and a former investigator at the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.
