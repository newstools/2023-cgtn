Food is a powerful reminder of wonderful home traditions. It brings us warmth and rekindles family affection through taste. As one of the most important celebrations of the Spring Festival, food is essential to a healthy, happy new year among Chinese. And, many dishes are imbued with auspicious and symbolic meanings either because of the appearance or the pronunciation of its Chinese name. The menu for the first meal of the Chinese Lunar New Year is an easy choice for Chinese. In northern China, dumplings are always the main dish on the dining table, while in southern China, there is a wide variety of choices in different provinces. Chinese food has also been highly favored by foreign friends over the years. World Insight with Tian Wei invites six friends from different countries to tell their stories about Chinese food.
