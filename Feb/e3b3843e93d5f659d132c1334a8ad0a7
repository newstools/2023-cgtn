"Good rain knows its time right; It will fall when comes spring," Du Fu, a great poet of the Tang Dynasty (618-907), wrote in his poem "Happy Rain on a Spring Night." Yushui, the spring's 2nd solar term that fell on February 19 this year, signals both an increase in rainfall and a rise in temperature. Following Yushui, nature reawakens. Plum, cherry, and apricot blossoms burst into bloom all across China. Known as one of the "Four Gentlemen," plum trees have always been favored by Chinese people. As the weather gradually warms up, plum blossoms in the areas, like Hangzhou Botanical Garden in Zhejiang and Century Park in Shanghai, prove a popular draw with visitors. Among them, Meihua Mountain in Nanjing, Jiangsu, with the reputation as the "mountain with the world's best plum blossoms" for its flourishing seas of blossoms, tops the list. In the provinces like Guangdong and Fujian, early cherry blossoms are already in bloom there. Every year in mid-to-late March, Hanfu enthusiasts gather at Baomo Garden in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province to hold the annual "Chinese Style Cherry Blossom Festival." The romantic cherry blossoms amid the ancient pavilions reflect the beauty of nature and profoundness of traditional Chinese culture with a harmonious resonance, offering tourists a unique opportunity to experience cherry blossoms in a classical garden setting. In addition to the gorgeous pink pageant, in Xinghua Village, Zhengzhou, pearly white apricot blossoms are also in bud. The blooming period for apricot blossoms lasts around just three weeks, and March is generally considered as the best time to admire their beauty. Zhangye, however, which is located in the northwest of Gansu Province, will usher in large-scale apricot blossoms from April to early May due to its altitude and climate. With flowers heralding the approach of spring, why not take advantage of the weekends and go out and experience these delightful blossoms?
