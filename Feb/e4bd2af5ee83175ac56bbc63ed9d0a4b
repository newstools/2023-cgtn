Argentina forward Lionel Messi is on the shortlist for the FIFA Best Male Player award, along with Paris St Germain teammate Kylian Mbappe and Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, football's world governing body announced on Friday. They are competing to succeed Robert Lewandowski, winner of the FIFA award in 2020 and 2021. Messi could win his second The Best trophy after leading Argentina to their third World Cup title by beating Mbappe's France in last year's final in Qatar, scoring seven goals during the tournament and earning his second Golden ball. World Cup Golden Boot winner Mbappe and France's 2022 Ballon d'Or winner Benzema feature for the first time among the three finalists. Meanwhile, two-time Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas of Spain, England forward Beth Mead and U.S. star Alex Morgan were nominated for the top women's prize. Barcelona midfielder Putellas won the women's award last year and is nominated again despite being out since July after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee. Arsenal striker Mead, runner-up to Putellas for the Ballon d'Or in October, is also currently sidelined with a long-term knee injury. The winners will be revealed on February 27 in Paris. They will be voted for by a jury made up of national team coaches and captains as well as journalists and fans. There are also prizes for the best male and female coach, the best goalkeeper and the Puskas Award for the best goal of 2022. (With input from agencies)
