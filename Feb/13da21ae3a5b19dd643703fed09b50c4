U.S. President Joe Biden remains "fit for duty" and fully executes all his responsibilities without any exemptions, the White House physician said on Thursday after Biden's physical exam. Biden's three-hour session with doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, was his second extensive exam since taking office in January 2021.
