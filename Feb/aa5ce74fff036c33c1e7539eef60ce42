Themed "It's Time for Wetlands Restoration," this year's World Wetlands Day (February 2) highlights the urgent need to prioritize wetland restoration. Various activities have been held across China to mark the day, as an effort to promote the public awareness on protecting wetlands. Chimelong Birds Park in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province, held an avian show that saw dozens of species soar above a lake to a melodious soundtrack, highlighting the beauty of the ecological environment and the habitat and behavior of wild birds. In east China's Jiangsu Province, Baima Lake Wetland Park offered a special tour at an exhibition hall for local primary school students to give them a comprehensive view of the wild animals that inhabit the wetland. Staff workers also held a ceremony to return an injured peregrine falcon to the wild after it had been rehabilitated. Over the years, China has stepped up its efforts to protect and expand its wetlands through the construction of national parks, restoration of shrinking wetlands, and other measures. China now has a wetland area covering 56.3 million hectares, according to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. That represents around 10 percent of the global total. The country also boasts 13 of the world's 43 wetland cities accredited by the Ramsar Convention. The ever-improving wetland ecosystem has helped the bird population increase while also boosting local biodiversity. The wetlands in cities and suburbs, in particular, deliver better living conditions for residents, and give the eco-tourism industry a shot in the arm.
