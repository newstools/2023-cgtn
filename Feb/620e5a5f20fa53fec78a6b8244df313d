A landmark power project in north China's Tianjin is entering its final stages of construction. This innovative project combines photovoltaic power generation with sea crystal salt production, making it a true game-changer. Upon completion, it's expected to generate 1.7 billion kWh on average each year, saving about 500,000 tonnes of standard coal and reducing 1.25 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually.
