"China's COVID-19 infection rate continues to maintain a stable situation," Mi Feng, the spokesperson of National Health Commission (NHC) said at a press conference on Monday. "All cases are found to be sporadically distributed, and no provinces were identified with significant rebounding cases," Mi added. COVID-19 has "basically ended" in China, but it is not "completely over", said top NHC health expert Liang Wannian last week. China downgraded its management of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B on January 8. "China has been efficient in coordinating between disease prevention and control, and economic and social development, creating a miracle in the history of human civilization for a country with a large population," Mi said. Following the achievement, China still needs to enhance the distribution and coordination of medical resources, strengthen the production of medical supplies and constantly work on the ability to deal with major public health emergencies, Mi added. As listed in the 14th Five-Year Plan, the country will set up some 20 national emergency response teams in addition to the 40 existing ones and dedicate them to major epidemic breakouts.
