China's first domestic air-cooled heavy-duty gas turbine with the highest energy-efficiency level was rolled off the production line in Qinhuangdao City of north China's Hebei Province, marking a breakthrough in the country's heavy-duty gas turbine manufacturing technology. A gas turbine, a device that converts natural gas and some other fuel into electricity as a core equipment for power plants, is described as the "crown jewel" by many engineers in China. The heavy-duty gas turbine that rolled off the production line this time represents the most advanced technology in the current gas turbine power generation industry. It is also the most efficient thermal power conversion equipment in the world today. The gas turbine has a length of 11 meters and weight of 400 tonnes. It can use natural gas as fuel and can also be mixed with hydrogen to reduce carbon emissions. Compared with coal-fired power plants, the annual operation of its one unit can reduce carbon emissions by more than 1.5 million tonnes. In addition, the gas turbine has strong peak-shaving capabilities and can increase power generation output within just one minute, providing support for new energy sources such as wind power and photovoltaic power generation. Its power generation efficiency exceeds 64 percent, with a maximum of more than 830,000 kilowatts. Read More: China ships its first F-class heavy-duty gas turbine
