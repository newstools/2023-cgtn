The two major earthquakes that hit Türkiye on Feb. 6 caused about $34.2 billion in direct physical damage, but total reconstruction and recovery costs facing the country could be twice as high, the World Bank said on Monday. The bank estimated that the earthquakes would also shave at least half a percentage point off Türkiye's forecast gross domestic product growth of 3.5 percent to 4 percent in 2023, Humberto Lopez, World Bank country director for Türkiye, told reporters.
