There is no single model for human rights development, and China opposes countries politicizing human rights issues and interfering in other countries' affairs by the name of human rights, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said via video link at a high-level segment of the 52nd regular session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on Monday. Qin said that there is no single model for human rights that fits all, and China adheres to its own path of human rights development, actively participates in global human rights governance, and has made historic achievements in promoting China's human rights cause. He said that the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China has drawn a blueprint for Chinese modernization, and it embodies the great cause of Chinese human rights development. Over the past 40 years, China has lifted nearly 800 million people out of poverty, accounting for more than 75 percent of global poverty reduction in the same period. And China has also built the largest social security system in the world. He calls for constructive dialogue and cooperation on human rights, saying division and bloc confrontation only do damage to human rights development, adding some countries are using the Xinjiang-related issues to suppress China's development and he welcomes countries to visit Xinjiang and have a look at Xinjiang's development.
