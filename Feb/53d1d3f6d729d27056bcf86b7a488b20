Oil and gas companies are not doing enough to cut emissions of methane – a powerful greenhouse gas, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday. In its latest annual Global Methane Tracker report, the IEA found that methane emissions from the energy sector rose slightly last year to 135 million tonnes, to just below the record set in 2019. "Our new Global Methane Tracker shows that some progress is being made but that emissions are still far too high and not falling fast enough – especially as methane cuts are among the cheapest options to limit near-term global warming," said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. "There is just no excuse." Methane is responsible for around 30 percent of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution. Cutting methane emissions may prove the best way to limit short-term global warming and rapidly improve air quality. The energy sector accounts for around 40 percent of total methane emissions attributable to human activity, second only to agriculture, and cost-effective solutions are available. "We estimate that around 70 percent of methane emissions from fossil fuel operations could be reduced with existing technology," the IEA said in the report.
