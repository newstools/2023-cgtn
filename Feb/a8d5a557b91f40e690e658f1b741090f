A warbling white-eye (Zosterops japonicus) was captured hopping and foraging among cherry flowers next to a river in Guiyang City, southwest China's Guizhou Province. Covered by yellow-olive plumage, the warbling white-eye is characterized by a prominent white coloring around its eye that gives it its name. The species lives in forests, shrublands, parks and urban areas. It feeds on fruit, insects, and takes nectar from the understory to the top of the forest canopy. The bird frequently travels in flocks, moving in swift bouncing flight through the canopy. Check out the photos to see the adorable creature.
