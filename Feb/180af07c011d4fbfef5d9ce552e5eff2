China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOC) on Tuesday expressed opposition to the U.S. putting six Chinese entities in an “entity list” of export control, calling for the U.S. to stop unreasonable oppression on Chinese enterprises. The MOC said it firmly opposes the listing for the so-called "supporting Chinese military aircraft." "The U.S. side has long been overstretching the concept of national security and abusing export controls," said an MOC spokesperson. "Such behavior has affected the stability of global industrial and supply chains and undermined the interests of global peace and development." The Chinese side will take necessary measures to safeguard the lawful rights of Chinese enterprises, it added. (Cover: China's Ministry of Commerce in Beijing, August 20, 2022. /CFP)
