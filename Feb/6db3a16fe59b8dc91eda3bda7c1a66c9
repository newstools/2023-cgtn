The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) will allow tech companies with no earnings or profit to list after a rule change in March, an official of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said on Sunday. The HKEX will adopt new main board listing rules in March to allow tech companies with no earnings or profit to list in Hong Kong, in a move to promote financial integration between Hong Kong and other cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), according to Christopher Hui, secretary for financial services and the treasury of HKSAR. Hui said that more than 600 private equity funds have come to Hong Kong, and the HKSAR government will offer tax arrangements and other assistance to help relevant funds enter the GBA in a more convenient manner. Private equity firms' entry into the GBA will also support the growth of Hong Kong's legal and accounting businesses, he added. The HKSAR is taking measures to shore up its position as a global financial center. The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, along with four other authorities, jointly issued two statements on Thursday aiming at providing stronger financial support for the construction and development of the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone.
