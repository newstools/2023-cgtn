Heavy rains in coastal areas of Brazil's southeast have caused flooding and landslides that killed 36 people and dislodged hundreds of others, according to a statement released by Sao Paulo state authorities on Sunday. Rescue workers continue to look for victims, reconnect isolated communities and clear roads, some of which remain blocked, trapping an undetermined number of tourists who traveled for Brazil's Carnival celebrations. Weather forecasts show heavy rains will continue in Sao Paulo's coastal area, challenging civil defense and fire department rescue teams and raising the prospect of a higher death toll. The federal government has mobilized several ministries to assist victims, restore infrastructure and start reconstruction work. Sao Paulo declared a 180-day state of calamity for six cities after what experts described as an unprecedented, extreme weather event.
