China has expressed firm opposition to the sanctions that the U.S. placed on Chinese firms for Russia-related reasons. "We deplore and reject the move," China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters on Monday's press briefing. Washington's course of action, which has neither basis in international law nor authorization from the UN Security Council, is a typical practice of "long-arm jurisdiction," severely violating China's interests, Mao said. She said China has been maintaining its neutrality and objectivity on the Ukraine conflict, actively pushing for peaceful dialogue and political solution, while the U.S. has been fueling the conflict by pouring over $32 billion of military aid into the battlefield. "It is as plain as daylight who is promoting peace and who is pouring fuel into the fire," Mao said. She called on the U.S. to stop spreading disinformation, drop its sanctions on Chinese companies and embark on a path to help ease the tension. "China will continue to take necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises," she said.
