American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an article on Wednesday saying that the U.S. and Norwegian governments have jointly conducted covert maritime operations since the Vietnam War. Referring to the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines, Hersh first asked why much of the secret planning and training for the operations occurred in Norway before providing the answer. "The simple answer is that the Norwegian Navy has a long and murky history of cooperation with American intelligence," the journalist said. He said, "Five months ago that teamwork – about which we still know very little – resulted in the destruction of two pipelines, on orders of (U.S.) President Biden, with international implications yet to be determined. And six decades ago, so the histories of those years have it, a small group of Norwegian seamen were entangled in a presidential deceit that led to an early – and bloody – turning point in the Vietnam War." He cited evidence that by 1964 at least two Norwegian seamen had confessed to complicity in covert operations organized by the CIA. According to Hersh, in 1964, Norway sold six combat boats to the U.S. and sent Norwegian seamen to "train" the U.S. and Vietnamese military in their use, but they were involved in the fighting.
