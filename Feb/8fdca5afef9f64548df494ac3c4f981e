Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's state visit to China is the first by an Iranian president in over 20 years. He tells CGTN anchor Wang Guan that the trip signals greater comprehensive China-Iran cooperation, with the implementation of their cooperation agreements. Iran becoming a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will also boost the bilateral relationship that goes back to the ancient Silk Road era.
