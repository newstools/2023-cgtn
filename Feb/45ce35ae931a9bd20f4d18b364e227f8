China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on Thursday said the country would welcome a visit by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. "It is very important for both sides to maintain normal communication. China has a welcoming attitude to Yellen's hope to visit China," said MOFCOM spokesperson Shu Jueting at a weekly press conference. These remarks came after Yellen on Wednesday said she still hoped to visit China, though she did not provide any specific details regarding timing. Last month, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke with Yellen about macroeconomic and financial issues during their meeting in Zurich, Switzerland. At that time, both sides agreed that strengthening communication and coordination of macroeconomic policies, as well as jointly responding to challenges, would benefit China, the U.S. and the world during a critical period of economic recovery.
