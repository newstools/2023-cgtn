Turpan is the first place in northwestÂ China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to see warm temperatures. The city is famous for its delectable fruits, including grapes, apricots and cantaloupes. And now, it is the season to grow watermelons. Local farmers have been busy germinating watermelon seeds and grafting seedlings in greenhouses since last month.
