A total of 86.12 percent of respondents to a global survey conducted by CGTN believe that China-U.S. relations should adhere to the principle of mutual benefit and win-win results, rather than a zero-sum game. Over three-quarters of respondents (76.12 percent) agreed that a sound China-U.S. relationship can benefit world peace, stability and lasting prosperity. In 2022, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and trade friction, the China-U.S. trade volume reached $760 billion, a historic high. China has always insisted on developing China-U.S. relations on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and argues that both sides should respect the majorÂ interests and core concerns of each other. Over two-thirds of respondents (60.59 percent) to the survey believe that China-U.S. relations can only return to a sound and stable track of development, and bring benefits to both countries, if a Cold War mentality is abandoned.
