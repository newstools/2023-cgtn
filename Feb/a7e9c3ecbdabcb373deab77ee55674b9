Iran's UN envoy, Amir Saeid Iravani, has asserted that a preliminary investigation suggests that Israel was responsible for the drone attack on a military facility in Isfahan, the semi-official ISNA news agency said on Thursday. "This action undertaken by Israel goes against international law and we condemn it," the agency quoted the ambassador as saying.
