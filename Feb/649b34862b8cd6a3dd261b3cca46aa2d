An ancient breed of Asian horses in Urumqi is attracting horse lovers to the Ancient Ecological Park in northwest China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region. The park is famed for rearing rare species of horses and is the largest exhibit base for the much-coveted Akhal-Teke horses, known for their speed and endurance. Other than being a hotspot for tourists, the park is also working on the breeding and protection of different horse breeds.
