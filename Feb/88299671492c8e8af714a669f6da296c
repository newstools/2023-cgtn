At the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen will pay an official visit to China from February 9 to 11, China's Foreign Ministry announced Monday. Speaking highly of the China-Cambodia relationship, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Hun Sen is a good old friend of the Chinese people as well as the first foreign leader to be received by China after the Chinese New Year, which fully demonstrated the high level of China-Cambodia relations. Mao said Chinese leaders would meet and hold talks with Hun Sen during his visit to exchange in-depth views on bilateral relations, regional and international issues of common interest. "China and Cambodia are traditionally friendly neighbors and 'hardcore' friends," said Mao. "The friendship forged by the older generation of leaders of the two countries has grown stronger ever since." She said under the strategic guidance of the two countries' leaders, building the China-Cambodia community with a shared future has yielded fruitful results in recent years, bringing tangible benefits to the two peoples and contributing to peace and prosperity in the region and beyond. This year, the "Cambodia-China Friendship Year", marks the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia. China looks forward to taking PM Hun Sen's visit as an opportunity to push for greater progress in building a China-Cambodia community with a shared future and pass on China-Cambodia friendship from generation to generation, Mao said.
