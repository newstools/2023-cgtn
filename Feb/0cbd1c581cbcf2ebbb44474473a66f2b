Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group is developing a ChatGPT-style artificial intelligence (AI) tool, which is currently in internal testing, the company told CGTN on Wednesday with no further details. Microsoft-backed OpenAI's chatbot sensation, ChatGPT, has sparked a gold rush in artificial intelligence (AI) technology for its impressive ability to write articles, poetry, essays and even codes in response to prompts. With ChatGPT's popularity growing, more and more tech giants have joined the heating-up chatbot contest. Chinese search engine giant Baidu on Tuesday said it was developing an AI-powered chatbot, which is set to be called ERNIE Bot and is likely to complete in March. Microsoft on Tuesday said it is fusing ChatGPT-like technology into its search engine, Bing, transforming an internet service that now trails far behind Google into a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence. On Monday, Google said it will release a conversational chatbot named Bard, which is based on the firm's Language Model for Dialogue Applications system (LaMDA). The system has been in development for several years. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in his blogÂ that the Bard conversational AI was to go out for testing with a plan to make it more widely available "in the coming weeks."
