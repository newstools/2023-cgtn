Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on Friday met with Andrew Hsia, vice chairperson of the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) party, in Beijing. "Taiwan independence" is incompatible with peace and runs counter to the well-being of Taiwan compatriots, Wang said. Noting that compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits have a strong desire for normal exchanges, Wang said the top priority is to restore the normalization of cross-Strait exchanges as soon as possible. "We welcome and support more Taiwan compatriots to participate in the cause of Chinese modernization and national rejuvenation, to share the fruits of development on the mainland and the glory of national rejuvenation," he said. Wang said the CPC and the KMT should further consolidate the political foundations of commonly upholding the 1992 Consensus and opposing "Taiwan independence," deepen mutual political trust, maintain positive interaction and strengthen exchanges and cooperation. He also called on the two parties to resolutely oppose separatist activities seeking "Taiwan independence" and interference from external forces, and jointly safeguard the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. On his part, Hsia said he hopes the two parties to strengthen mutual trust and communication, and enhance cooperation on the basis of upholding the 1992 Consensus and opposing "Taiwan independence," so as to promote the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.
