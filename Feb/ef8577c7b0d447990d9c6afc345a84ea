CGTN correspondent Iolo Ap Dafydd found a small corner shop that is still open in Chasiv Yar despite the artillery shelling in nearby Bakhmut in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. Only four shops are still open in this town, which was once home to over 20,000 people. Those who chose to stay on come to buy meat and cakes, and more importantly, bread. Other than food, people come here to have a chance to talk to each other, and possibly get the latest news.
