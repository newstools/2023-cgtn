Who would have thought that after nearly two-thirds of matches in the 2022-23 season, Arsenal are leading the Premier League over Manchester City, especially when "The Gunners" played one fewer game? Meanwhile, just in case you haven't noticed, Manchester United, which have been seen as a bad example for heavyweights in recent years, are only six points behind Man City. The "Red Devils" do not pose an immediate threat yet to the top two teams, but they are capable of causing trouble for both. Bundesliga is looking at a new scenario as well this season. Instead of Bayern Munich booking the championship with four or five games to go, or facing competition from only one rival, the German powerhouse now have to watch out for both Borussia Dortmund and Union Berlin. In fact, even Red Bull Leipzig and Freiburg may join the race any time when Bayern suffer a sudden major setback in Bundesliga.
