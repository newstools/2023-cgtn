Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said consensus was building in the Arab world that isolating Syria was not working and that dialogue with Damascus was needed "at some point" to at least address humanitarian issues, including a return of refugees. He made the remarks during a forum on the sidelines of the 59th Munich Security Conference in Germany. "You will see not just among the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) but in the Arab world there is a consensus growing that the status quo is not workable," he said. The foreign minister said in the absence of a path towards "maximalist goals" for a political solution, another approach was "being formulated" to address the issue of Syrian refugees in neighboring states and suffering of civilians, especially after the devastating earthquakes that hit Syria and Türkiye. Over 46,000 people have been killed in the deadly earthquakes that struck Türkiye and neighboring Syria on February 6. "So that's going to have to go through a dialogue with the government in Damascus at some point in a way that achieves at least the most important of the objectives especially as regards the humanitarian angle, the return of refugees, etc," he said. Saudi Arabia has sent aid planes to government-held territory in Syria as part of earthquake relief efforts after initially sending aid only to the country's opposition-held northwest.
