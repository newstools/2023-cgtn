China's Foreign Ministry on Monday said an uncrewed airship sighted in Latin America is from China and is for civilian purpose of flight testing. Affected by the weather with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course and unintendedly entered the airspace of Latin America and the Caribbean, said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning. Mao said China had informed all parties concerned and the airship would not pose any threat to any countries.
