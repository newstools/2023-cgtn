A unique feature of "Dance of the Heroes" is the Yingge hammer. Performers hold two of these stick-like objects, one in each hand, and use them to beat a rhythm. The movements of the sticks must be synchronized with the drums and other musical instruments, as well as the actions of all the performers.
