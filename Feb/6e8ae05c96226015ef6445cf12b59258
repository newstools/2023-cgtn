Southeast Asian countries have become the most popular travel destinations for Chinese tourists since China resumed its outbound tourism after a three-year hiatus due to the pandemic. The most popular destination is Thailand, followed by Cambodia, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, according to Chinese travel website LY.com. China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed a pilot program for national travel agencies and online travel companies operating outbound group tours and offering "air ticket + hotel" packages to Chinese travelers. Twenty countries were in the first batch to receive Chinese group tours, including Thailand, Singapore, Kenya, Russia, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Argentina. On February 6, the first two Chinese tour groups arrived in Bangkok, Thailand. Officials from the Thai tourism authority and the Chinese Embassy in Thailand welcomed the tourists from Guangzhou at Don Mueang International Airport. During their six-day tour, they are set to visit Bangkok and the seaside resorts of southern Thailand. Also on Monday, a flight carrying a group of around 140 Chinese tourists landed at Phnom Penh International Airport from Shenzhen, receiving a warm welcome from Cambodian travel operators. They are expected to visit the capital city Phnom Penh, the cultural province of Siem Reap, and the coastal province of Preah Sihanouk on their five-day tour. As one of the most popular destinations among Chinese travelers, Singapore greeted the first Chinese tour group on Monday after China resumed outbound group travel. During their trip, the group will experience the culture and customs of Singapore and sample authentic local food.
