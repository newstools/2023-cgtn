China's decision to include two U.S. defense contractors on its Unreliable Entity List over their involvement in arms sales to China's Taiwan region was law-based, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Friday. Lockheed Martin Corporation and Raytheon Missiles & Defense have repeatedly conducted arms sales to Taiwan in disregard of China's strong opposition, severely undermining China's national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity, the spokesperson said in a statement.
