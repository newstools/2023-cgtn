The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Thursday that EU Military Assistance Mission would train additional 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers, taking the total number of trained personnel to 30,000, after meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal in Kyiv. The EU would also provide 25 million euros (about $27.5 million) to support demining efforts in endangered areas, Borrell said.
