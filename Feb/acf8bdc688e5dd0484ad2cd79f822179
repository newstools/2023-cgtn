The proportion of China's electrical energy is expected to exceed 30 percent of the country's total terminal energy consumption by 2025, according to a report released by China Electric Power Enterprise Federation on Friday.Statistics showed that China's current terminal energy consumption electrification rate stands at 27 percent, higher than the world's average level. The electrification rate refers to the proportion of electricity consumption by all sectors of the national economy and people's daily life, and its improvement will help reduce pollutant emissions and develop energy utilization efficiency. "China will vigorously facilitate the replacement of coal and oil with electricity in the fields of industry, transportation, construction and agriculture as well as in rural areas," Yang Kun, executive vice president of the China Electricity Council, told China Media Group (CMG). "More efforts will be made to improve the energy price mechanism, accelerate the deep integration of electrification, digitalization, and informatization to comprehensively elevate the intelligent and efficient level of terminal energy consumption." Currently, China's electrification rate in the industrial sector stands at 26.2 percent, with 44.9 percent in the construction sector and 3.9 percent in the transportation sector. About 5.2 million charging infrastructure units have been set up across China, shaping the world's largest charging network. In rural areas, the electrification rate reaches 35.2 percent as the population has better access to electricity with the wide use of electrification equipment for agricultural machinery. By the end of 2022, China had built the world's largest clean power generation system, with a total installed power generation capacity of 2.56 billion kilowatts (kWs), of which 1.27 billion kWs was generated by non-fossil energy, accounting for 49.6 percent of the total installed power generation capacity and becoming the main body of installed power generation.
