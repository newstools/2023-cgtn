Authorities say at least 19 people have died in several cities in Sao Paulo in southeastern Brazil amid floods and landslides and warn the number could rise. The cities of Sao Sebastiao and Bertioga, two of the hardest hit, canceled their carnival festivities as rescue teams struggled to find the missing, injured and feared dead. The Sao Paulo state government said precipitation in the region surpassed 600 millimeters in one day, one of the highest amounts ever recorded in such a short period in Brazil. Governor Tarcisio de Freitas said he had requested support from the army, which will send two planes and rescue teams to the region. He issued a public calamity decree for the cities of Ubatuba, Sao Sebastiao, Ilhabela, Caraguatatuba and Bertioga.
