Jimmy Carter, the 98-year-old former U.S. president, is receiving hospice care at home, the Carter Center said in a statement on Saturday. "After a series of short hospital stays, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter today decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention," the statement said.
