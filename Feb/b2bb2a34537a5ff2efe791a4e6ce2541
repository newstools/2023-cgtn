Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday that it regretted the unintended entry of a Chinese civilian airship into U.S. airspace due to force majeure. "It is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes. Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course," said a ministry spokesperson in a statement. The Chinese side will continue communicating with the U.S. side and properly handle this unexpected situation.
