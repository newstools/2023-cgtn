The Peruvian Congress again rejected a bill on Thursday to advance the general elections to December 2023. The vote was the fourth attempt to move the elections, after a vote on Wednesday delivered the same result. The proposal for early elections is backed by President Dina Boluarte, but Congress is deeply divided. Political unrest was sparked on December 7, when Boluarte took office following the ouster of her predecessor Pedro Castillo, who was impeached just hours after his failed attempt to dissolve the legislature, leading to his detention by security forces. Lawmakers had previously agreed to move the date of the elections to April 2024.
