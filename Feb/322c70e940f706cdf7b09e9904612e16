A new documentary series about 86-year-old Chinese artist Han Meilin, who created the Fuwa mascots for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, was launched in Beijing on Friday. The six-episode documentary series by China Media Group (CMG) entitled "Han Meilin" aims to focus on how the renowned artist has combined Chinese and Western culture, as well as traditional and modern art, to attain laudable achievements in calligraphy, painting, ceramics, sculpture, design, and many other fields during his 70-year career. The documentary series uses new technologies and innovative perspectives to showcase not only Han's diverse artworks but also the Chinese aesthetics rooted in traditional culture that continue to keep up with modern times. Born in east China's Shandong Province, Han Meilin, whose works adhere to traditional techniques in Chinese art, has held solo exhibitions in many Western countries such as Canada, Italy, and France. His most well known creations are the Fuwa, or good-luck mascots for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. Han also designed the Five-Dragon Clock Tower for the 1996 Atlanta Summer Games. He was named a UNESCO Artist For Peace in 2015 for his long-term commitment to promoting art and artistic education in China.
