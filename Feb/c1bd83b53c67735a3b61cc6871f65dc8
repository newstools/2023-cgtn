China is ready to work with the United Nations (UN) to address global challenges, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday during his meeting with Csaba Korosi, president of the 77th UN General Assembly. China is willing to work with all parties to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, the basic norms of international law and international relations, promote economic globalization and world multipolarization, and maintain world peace and stability, Li said. As a founding member of the UN and a permanent member of the Security Council, China will continue to actively support and participate in the work of the UN, strengthen coordination and cooperation in areas such as sustainable development, climate change, water resources and UN reform. Li said that China is a defender and participant of the existing international order, and a beneficiary and promoter of global openness. No matter how the international situation changes, China will unswervingly follow the road of peaceful development, adhere to the basic state policy of reform and opening-up, pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win outcome, promote the common values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom for all mankind, develop itself through extensive international exchange and cooperation, and also provide new opportunities for world development, he added. Korosi said the UN hopes to deepen friendship and strengthen cooperation with China to jointly address the political, economic, ecological, water and humanitarian crises facing the world today, achieve sustainable development, and promote change based on scientific decision-making mechanisms. The UN appreciates China's support for the work of the UN and looks forward to China continuing to play a greater role in many aspects, he said.
