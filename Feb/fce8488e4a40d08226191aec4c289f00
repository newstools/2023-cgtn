U.S. President Joe Biden called for bipartisan unity in his second State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday. "We're often told that Democrats and Republicans can't work together. But over the past two years, we proved the cynics and naysayers wrong," he said in his first address to a joint session of Congress since Republicans took control of the House of Representatives. Biden said that the U.S. has emerged stronger from the pandemic and touted the economic progress made under his administration. "We have created a record 12 million new jobs. More jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years."
