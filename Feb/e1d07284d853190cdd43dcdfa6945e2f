"The U.S. response was certainly an overreaction," Prof. Kenneth Hammond from New Mexico State University told CGTN Radio's Xu Yawen, commenting on the recent balloon incident that intensified U.S.-China relationship. "They say it's a suspected spy balloon, but I think they have to say that because there is no evidence, there is no indication, there is no proof that it was anything other than a completely benign weather balloon or communications balloon," said Hammond. "Now, the Americans have been forced to admit that it wasn't actually sent to pass over the United States, but was blown off by unanticipated weather patterns." Hammond said the U.S. overreaction on the whole balloon incident reflected the country's "hostility and aggressive" attitude towards China, which has become "characteristic" of American political leaders and American corporate media. "China is automatically suspected, China is automatically viewed in a negative light." Hammond noted that the U.S. response made itself look "silly" in front of the world. "We went on and shot down three other completely innocent aircrafts that had nothing to do with anything. It simply was a waste of resources and just a hysterical kind of reaction."
