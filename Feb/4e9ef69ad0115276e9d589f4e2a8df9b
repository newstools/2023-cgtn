Rescue operations continue in the southern province of Osmaniye, which was devastated by the earthquake, with many residential buildings collapsed or severely damaged. Distraught family members of missing residents are hoping that miracles can emerge from beneath the rubble. Like many other family members of missing residents, Fatih comes to the site every day. He said that three children of his brother and sister-in-law survived the disaster, but the couple has been left buried in a nine-story building. He said he would keep waiting and praying for a positive outcome for his family.
