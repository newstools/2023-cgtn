China's Chen Wenhao won bronze in men's skeleton at the World Cup in Innsbruck, Austria on Friday. This was the first time for Chen, and the second for Team China, to clinch a medal in this event at World Cup. The first was a gold from Geng Wenqiang in November 2021, also in Innsbruck.Â Team GB's Matt Weston won gold in 1:42.96, and Jung Seung-gi of South Korea took silver in 1:43.32. Chen, 26, finished third in 1:43.45, followed by Olympic champion Christopher Grotheer from Germany and compatriot Yin Zheng who came in fifth. Chen and Yin were ranked ninth and 11th, respectively, at the World Championships last week, with teammate Yan Wengang, who won bronze at the Beijing Winter Olympics, finishing sixth. Comprised of eight legs, the IBSF (International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation) World Cup of 2022-23 season will come to its last stop a week later in Sigulda, Latvia.
