China unveiled its "No. 1 central document" for 2023 on Monday, outlining nine tasks in promoting rural revitalization this year. With a rural population of about 500 million, China is putting their development issues at the center of its working agenda. Zhang Chuanhong, associate professor at China Agricultural University, says there are two things highlighted in the "No. 1 central document." Â The first one is food security, the second one is rural revitalization. Chief researcher at the D&C think tank Li Yong added that he paid great attention to the key goal of achieving a "strong agriculture country."
