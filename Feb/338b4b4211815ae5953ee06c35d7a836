Located in a cold and high mountainous area of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with rich tourism resources, Dazhai Village has been named among the 2022 "Best Tourism Villages" by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). The agricultural heritage of Dazhai Village, represented by Longji Terraces, symbolizes the farming culture of various ethnic groups in China. In its development of rural tourism, this hillside village combines the local farming culture with elements of modern civilization to attract visitors to experience farming activities such as harvesting and drying rice. The village also provides lectures on traditional agriculture and wetland science, as well as a range of research programs to actively preserve the cultural heritage of China's rice terraces. In promoting itself as a tourist destination, Dazhai Village strengthens the protection of terraced fields to ensure the sustainable development of agricultural production and tourism. Tourists can experience various cultural activities, including trying Red Yao embroidery dances, and living in a traditional wooden building of the Red Yao ethnic group. The extensive and profound Red Yao ethnic culture and the magnificent terraces complement each other, demonstrating the wisdom of ancient Chinese agriculture. The successful development of agricultural tourism has improved the villagers' incomes and considerably boosted their livelihoods. The UNWTO began the process of selecting its list of "Best Tourism Villages" in 2021, with the goal of promoting the protection and sustainable development of rural cultural heritage through tourism. In 2022, a total of 136 candidate villages from 57 countries participated in the selection, with 32 ultimately chosen.
