The 15th day of the Spring Festival is also known as the Lantern Festival. That is how important lanterns are during the Spring Festival celebrations. This year's Zigong International Dinosaur Lantern Festival is like no other. It is China's first "story + gamification" immersive lantern festival â€“ combining "live" experiences with virtual reality, in hopes to attract more young people. Zigong in southwest China's Sichuan Province is a city famous for its lanterns. People there have been making lanterns for thousands of years and they believe that lanterns light people's way to prosperity.
