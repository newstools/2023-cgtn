Chinese rescue teams started operations in Türkiye's southern province of Hatay, which suffered the most loss of life in Monday's earthquakes. An 82-member Chinese rescue team started its efforts at 21:00 local time on Wednesday from a collapsed five-story apartment, where 10 residents were missing. The team, dispatched by the Chinese Ministry of Emergency Management, carried with them rescue equipment and supplies. The first team of China's civil squad aiding the quake relief efforts in Türkiye, the Ramunion Rescue, also reached Iskenderun in Hatay from Adana at around 19:00 local time.
