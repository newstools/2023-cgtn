Plum blossoms take center stage in Chen Jialing's new exhibition at Rongbaozhai, a famous painting and calligraphy shop in Beijing. The veteran artist is known for his unique take on traditional Chinese painting, combining impressionism and expressionism with more abstract techniques. Flowers are among his many signature motifs, demonstrating his masterful use of ink. And with plum blossoms now blooming in the Chinese capital, his artistic renderings couldn't be more timely.
