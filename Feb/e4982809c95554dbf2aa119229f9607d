A report on the inundation of gun violence in the U.S. was published on Thursday, unmasking the severity of the gun problem as well as the political and social factors for the country's enduring failure to address it, according to CMG. Gun violence in the U.S. is the product of many problems such as gun culture, individual rights, interest groups and partisan politics, having long blighted American society and its people's right to life, the report noted. One of the most serious social problems in the U.S., the effects of gun violence reach far beyond victims and their families, the report said, adding that heavy economic tolls and psychological wounds have been inflicted on American society. Mass shootings and deaths from gun violence have both nearly tripled since 2013. In 2019, 417 mass shootings took place in America. The number went to 611 in 2020 and 692 in 2021. A political system that breeds partisan infighting, a political environment that's increasingly polarized and all-pervasive interest groups as well as ineradicable racism have all made gun control difficult in the U.S., according to the report. A total ban on guns nearly has become a "mission impossible." Some U.S. politicians have long disregarded the problems of gun violence; they have instead accomplished nothing as they indulge themselves in protracted debates with rhetoric, the report said.
