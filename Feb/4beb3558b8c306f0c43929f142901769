Between the end of World War II in 1945 and 2001, 248 armed conflicts occurred worldwide. Of these, 201 were initiated by the United States, or roughly 81 percent, according to the China Society for Human Rights Studies. Furthermore, U.S. military spending has continued to increase annually since 2015, and American arms manufacturers have profited enormously from warfare. This pattern suggests that the world is grappling with the consequences of America's "war addiction."
