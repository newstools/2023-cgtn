The UK and the European Union agreed to a revised deal on the Northern Ireland protocol on Monday, according to the BBC. "An agreement has been reached. The deal is done," the broadcaster reported citing an anonymous senior government source. The report came nearly one hour after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met in Windsor. The two are expected to hold a short joint press conference after a deal was reached.
