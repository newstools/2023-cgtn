Mohammed Shahabuddin Chuppu, a retired judge and former commissioner of the Anti-Corruption Commission, was declared as the president-elect of Bangladesh on Monday. Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal made the announcement at a press conference in Dhaka, saying the ruling Bangladesh Awami League (AL) party nominee was elected unopposed. The incumbent president Abdul Hamid cannot be re-elected as president for another term as the country's constitution allows a maximum of two terms for president. Hamid's second and last tenure will expire on April 24.
