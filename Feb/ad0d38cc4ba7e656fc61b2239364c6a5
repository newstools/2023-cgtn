Plummeting temperatures in parts of China have created a stunning view of snow, rime and ice cascades, as if they are gifts from nature before the spring comes. The magnificent scenery has attracted groups of tourists to indulge in the silvery landscapes. Heavy snow blanketed the terraces in the middle section of the Taihang Mountains in Pingding County, north China's Shanxi Province, on Monday, creating spectacular scenes that delighted local residents and tourists alike. Rime is formed when water vapor in the air freezes rapidly on the surfaces of plants. With an elevation ofÂ about 1,500 meters, rime-coated trees in the Tianmen Mountain National Forest Park in Zhangjiajie City of central China's Hunan Province can be seen everywhere. "It's the first time for me to see the rime, because I come from south China's Guangdong Province. The beautiful views wowed me a lot and I have taken many photos and videos," a tourist surnamed Liao said. At Da'erbin Lake of Greater Hinggan Mountains, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, splendid ice cascades have formed in various colors thanks to the freezing weather, drawing a lot of tourists and photographers. "There are four ice cascades in total, presenting the colors of cyan, yellow, blue and bluish white, which are very charming," said Gao Yiwei, a shutterbug.
