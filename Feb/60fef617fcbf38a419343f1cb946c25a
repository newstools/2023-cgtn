Scotland's Outer Hebrides lie on the edge of northwestern Europe. The incredible landscape is the inspiration for the colors that are woven into the famous fabric that is made there. Harris Tweed Hebrides is one of three mills on the island. The mill produces over 50 base colors. Once dyed, these are combined to make infinite blends. The wool is then carded and spun into yarn. Protected by parliament, the rules governing Harris Tweed are strict. The cloth must be woven by hand, by the people of the Outer Hebrides.
