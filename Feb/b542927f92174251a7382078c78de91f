Infrared cameras in Shennongjia National Park, central China's Hubei Province, capture animal activities, providing first-hand information for investigation and monitoring.Home to many rare animals, Shennongjia is the transitional area of plant species between northern and southern China.In order to strengthen investigation and monitoring of wild animals, the administrative authority of Shennongjia deployed 300 more high-definition infrared cameras in the area in 2022.The staff at the Shennongjia National Park recently went deep into the forest to collect first-hand information about wild animals from the infrared cameras in preparation for the monitoring of the upcoming breeding season.The staff collected materials from over 20 infrared cameras this time. They said the materials cover a large number of wild animals, with many videos showing rare scenes of mother and children staying together or family members moving around."In 2022, we collected footage from 450 infrared cameras and got 1.8 terabytes of valid data, including 20,000 pictures. From the footage, we found more than 30 new distribution sites of various species including golden snub-nosed monkeys, forest musk deer and sika deer. There were also five new species captured by infrared cameras for the first time, including Eurasian sparrowhawks and lesser necklaced laughingthrushes," said Yu Huiliang, deputy director of the scientific research institute of the Shennongjia National Park Administration.
