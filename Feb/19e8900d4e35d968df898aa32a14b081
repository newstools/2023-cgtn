China will not accept the U.S. proposal of a phone conversation between the two countries' defense ministers given the "irresponsible and wrong actions of the U.S.," Tan Kefei, spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense, said on Thursday. The U.S. side's insistence on the recent shooting down of Chinese civilian unmanned airship was a serious violation of international practice and set a bad precedent, Tan said.
