Israeli air strikes hit Gaza overnight on Thursday, Palestinian media reported, hours after the Israeli military said it intercepted a rocket fired from the strip. The Israeli defense forces later confirmed it struck a production site for raw chemical material production, along with a weapon manufacturing site in the area "in response to the rocket launch from Gaza into Israel earlier today".
