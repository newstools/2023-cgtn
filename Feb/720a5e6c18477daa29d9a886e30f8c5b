Leeds United have fired their manager Jesse Marsch, the club announced on Monday. "Leeds United can confirm head coach Jesse Marsch has been relieved of his duties. Jesse joined the club in February 2022 and was instrumental in keeping the club in the Premier League on the final day of last season. Rene Maric, Cameron Toshack and Pierre Barrieu will also leave the club," Leeds said in a statement. The team's disappointing performance so far in the 2022-23 season is the major reason behind Marsch's departure. They have won only four of the past 20 games and lost 10 of them. Having been winless in the past seven games, Leeds are currently 17th on the standings table in the Premier League with 18 points. The only thing that keeps them away from the relegation zone is their lead in goal difference over Everton. Marsch took over from Marcelo Bielsa in February 2022 when the club was on the edge of relegation. Marsch helped the them stay in the top league in the end. Leeds managed to upset Liverpool and Chelsea this season under him, but they missed a lot of wins that they should have seized. "We would like to thank Jesse and his backroom staff for their efforts and wish them well for the future. The process of appointing a new head coach is underway and we will continue to keep supporters up to date throughout the coming days," the club said. Leeds will begin a difficult trip in the coming six games as they will play Manchester United twice, Everton, Southampton, Chelsea and Brighton in order. Man United are third on the standings table; Chelsea have spent 329.5 million euros (about $353.4 million) during the winter transfer window enhancing their lineup; both Everton and Southampton are battling to stay in the Premier League; Brighton rank sixth on the standings table but they have scored 38 goals in 20 games, the fourth-most among 20 teams. If Leeds perform too poorly in the six games, they can be in a very disadvantageous position in the race to avoid relegation.
