European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen arrived in London on Monday for talks with the UK in reaching a new deal on post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland. "I'm glad to be in the UK today to meet with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. I'm looking forward to turning a page and opening a new chapter with our partner and friend," she tweeted. In response, Sunak said he looks forward to meeting with von der Leyen in Windsor "for further talks on the shared, practical solutions to the range of complex challenges around the Northern Ireland Protocol." Sunak will make a statement in parliament at 1830 GMT on Monday to provide an update regarding post-Brexit trading rules in Northern Ireland.

The EU chief is also scheduled to meet King Charles for tea at Windsor Castle on Monday afternoon, which has drawn criticism from some politicians, questioning whether or not that the monarch, who constitutionally is not supposed to be involved in political matters, was being pulled into the Brexit debate by the government. "The king is pleased to meet any world leader if they are visiting Britain and it is the government's advice that he should do so," a palace spokesperson said. Sunak's spokesman said it was not unusual for the government to provide the monarch with advice. "It is a matter for the palace to decide, and ultimately for the king to decide, if he wants to meet individuals," the spokesman said. "His majesty has met with a number of foreign leaders recently, this is no different." (With input from Reuters)
