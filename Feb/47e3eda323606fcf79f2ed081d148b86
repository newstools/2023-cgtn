The death toll has risen to six, and 47 people remain missing, nearly two days after a coal mine collapsed in Alxa League in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Another six people were successfully pulled out by 10:30 p.m. on Thursday as rescuers continued searching for the missing personnel.
