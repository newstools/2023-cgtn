Bayern Munich's 1-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday night was like déjà vu of many of their Bundesliga games this season. They had the apparent advantage, but shied away from finishing the final scoring move. PSG did Bayern a favor by replacing Achraf Hakimi with Presnel Kimpembem and leaving 16-year-old Warren Zaire-Emery to guard Alphonso Davies alone. PSG soon sent Kylian Mbappe to the field after allowing the goal by Kingsley Coman. Mbappe's speed plus the creativity of Lionel Messi and Neymar immediately took the club’s offense up a notch. Unfortunately, both of the two goals Mbappe scored were ruled offside. PSG will visit the Allianz Arena next week with a one-goal deficit.
