Editor's note: As the death toll from the devastating earthquakes mounts in TÃ¼rkiye and Syria, The Hub with Wang Guan looks at the tragedy of a nation hit by multiple crises with this exclusive with Mohammed Hasanein Khaddam, Syrian Ambassador to China. Khaddam says the catastrophe has been compounded by U.S.-led Western sanctions and calls for them to be lifted so that humanitarian assistance can reach people sooner and more lives can be saved. He calls the situation in Syria the "indefensible" result of the U.S. "rules-based order" and hopes the earthquakes will shake nations' conscience. While the Western media is ignoring Syria, he says the Chinese leadership and ordinary people have stood by Syria with genuine empathy and assistance and appreciates China's diplomatic support in the UN when some Western nations tried to target Syria: "The (Chinese) generosity has always been there."
