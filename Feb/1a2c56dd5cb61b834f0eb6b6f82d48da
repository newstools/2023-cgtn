A wildlife park welcomed six baby takins - three males and three females - during the Spring Festival holiday season in Xi'an City of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, according to the park on Thursday.At the Xi'an Qinling Wildlife Park, breeders have set up a special area for the newborns. The black-backed baby takins, have a much darker coat than adults. They are cautiously exploring the new world, sometimes climbing the haystacks, and sometimes playing with each other.Among the newborns, the oldest was born on January 22, the first day of the Chinese new year, and the youngest on February 3, weighing around nine kilograms at birth."Two were born on the second day of the Chinese new year, and another two on the fourth. They are in good condition and dynamic. We took special care of them during that period and visited them on a regular basis every day," said Liu Peng, head of prairie section of the park.Takins are listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and under first-class state protection in China.As the largest herbivore around the Qinling Mountains, adult takins are ferocious. However, the baby takins are quite adorable, with their sparking eyes looking curiously at the camera lens."We keep the babies together, which can make it easy for us to observe and feed them, in order to increase their survival rate. For the mother takins, we have to improve their nutrition and increase their milk yield, so as to ensure health of the babies," Liu said.The baby takins are expected to meet the public at the park in May.
