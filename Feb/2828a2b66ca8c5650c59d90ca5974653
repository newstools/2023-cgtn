Chinese center Han Xu has re-signed with the WNBA's New York Liberty, the team announced on Friday. "Liberty center @hanxu_521 has accepted her qualifying offer and re-signed with New York. Welcome back, Han!" The Liberty posted on Instagram. Han was drafted by the Liberty with the 14th pick in 2019 and played 15 games for the team in her first WNBA season. Having stayed away from the league due to COVID-19 for two seasons in 2020 and 2021, she rejoined the Liberty in 2022 and averaged 8.5 points and 3.6 rebounds in 31 games. The Liberty made the playoffs last season as Han could get 5.3 points and 2.7 rebounds per game. The team lost to the Chicago Sky 2-1 in the first round. The Liberty signed two-time WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Breanna Stewart during the off season to improve their lineup and race for the WNBA championship in the new season that will begin on May 19. Having steeled herself well in the WNBA, Han made key contributions for China in the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup in Sydney, Australia, in 2022. The team lost to only USA to finish the competitions as the runners-up. The remarkable performances of Chinese players in the World Cup drew more attention from the WNBA teams. For example, Yang Liwei was offered a two-year deal by the Los Angeles Sparks this week, according to Chinese basketball reporter Mai Suifeng. Yang, 28, has been one of the most dominant players in the WCBA in recent years. She has won three WCBA championships for the Guangdong Vermilion Birds (once) and the Inner Mongolia Rural Credit Union between 2018 and 2022. Yang's Rural Credit Union teammate Li Yueru played in the Sky last season. If Yang joins the WNBA, she will become the third Chinese player in the world's top women's basketball league.
