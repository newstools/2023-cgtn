China pocketed a gold, a silver and a bronze at the 2022-2023 ISU Short Track Speed Skating World Cup in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, on Sunday. Lin Xiaojun clocked 40.693 seconds to win the men's 500m, a back-to-back victory in this category. South Korean Lim Yong-jin and Lukasz Kuczynski of Poland came second and third, respectively. Kuczynski led the sprint race for much of the final, before being overtaken near the very end by the two sprint sensations. After the game, the Pole admitted that he lost pressure under his blade, "I wasn't able to turn so much in one of the corners and then Lin immediately passed me. That was perfect from his side and that's also showing me what the best in the world are able to do." The Chinese team of Lin Xiaojun, Zhong Yuchen and Song Jiahua came behind South Korea in the men's 5,000m relay final to settle for silver, and Japan finished third. In the women's 3,000m relay, China (Gong Li, Xu Aili, Wang Xinran and Zang Yize) took the bronze. Canada and Hungary finished first and second, respectively. Dutch skater Xandra Velzeboer claimed the women's 500m title in 42.020. Park Ji-won of South Korea won the men's 1,000m in 1:25.359. Song Jiahua finished fourth in 1:25.671. Canadian Courtney Sarault triumphed in the women's 1,000m. All six legs of the World Cup have wrapped up, with the young Chinese squad winning a total of four golds, three silvers and three bronzes. Lin alone won three golds and two silvers. The 2023 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships will take place in Seoul, South Korea from March 10 to 12. (With input from agencies)
