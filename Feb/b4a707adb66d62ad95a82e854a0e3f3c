Soleil is a musician and a young mother from Siem Reap in Cambodia. For more than eight years, she's been a dedicated member of the local theatrical troupe. Thanks to talented performers like her, and a much-needed injection of professional theater design and technology courtesy of a Chinese company, the Smile of AnkorÂ show has become a must-see theatrical extravaganza showcasing the beauty of Cambodian culture, bringing extra income for local performers like Soleil.
