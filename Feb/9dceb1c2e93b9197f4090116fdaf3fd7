In rural Lanzhou, a grand banquet is an essential part of the most important celebrations. With the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, villagers have been able to get together to celebrate such occasions as weddings in the traditional way. For Liu Lei, who has been catering for grand banquets for the past six years, this means that business is picking up. In just over a month since the start of the year, he has received nearly 30 bookings. In the serene winter village setting, the grand banquet is like a symphony played by the villagers and conducted by maestro Liu.
