U.S. automaker Ford plans to cut around 3,800 jobs in Europe over the next three years, the company said on Tuesday, citing rising costs and the need for a leaner structure as it pivots production to electric vehicles. The company said 2,300 positions in product development and administrative functions would be slashed in Germany, 1,300 in Britain and another 200 elsewhere in Europe. Ford said it was "responding to rapidly changing market conditions and a growing field of electric vehicle competitors entering the market." Martin Sander, the European passenger EV chief and head of Ford Germany, said there is significantly less work to be done on drivetrains moving out of combustion engines. "We are moving into a world with less global platforms where less engineering work is necessary. This is why we have to make the adjustments," he said. Nothing has changed in the carmaker's electrification strategy, Sander added, with the goal of offering an all-electric fleet in Europe by 2035 still in place. Ford said the job reductions would be done through voluntary departures and that it would maintain an engineering organization of around 3,400 roles in Europe focusing on vehicle design and development. Last year, the U.S. auto giant announced thousands of job cuts in the United States and India. In a separate announcement, Ford earlier said it would collaborate with a Chinese supplier, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL), on a new $3.5 billion battery plant for electric vehicles in Michigan. (With input from AFP, Reuters)
