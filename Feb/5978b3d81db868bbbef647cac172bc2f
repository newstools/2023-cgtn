China looks forward to working with Belarus to take its president Alexander Lukashenko's visit to China as an opportunity to further promote all-round cooperation between the two countries, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Monday. Lukashenko will pay a state visit to China from February 28 to March 2. Mao said that China and Belarus are all-weather comprehensive strategic partners. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 31 years ago, the two countries have steadily strengthened political mutual trust, deepened mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields and maintained closer coordination in international and regional affairs. She also mentioned the meeting between the two heads of state on the sidelines of the 22nd meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Samarkand, Uzbekistan last year, at which China and Belarus agreed to upgrade bilateral relations to the all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership.
