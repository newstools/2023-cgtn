China on Thursday successfully launched its first high-throughput communication satellite with a capacity of over 100 Gbps, which will provide high-speed broadband services. The satellite, named "ChinaSat 26," was sent into orbit atop a Long March-3B carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province. It will mainly provide high-speed broadband services for fixed terminals as well as vehicle-mounted, shipborne and airborne terminals. The satellite, considered as an important part of China's space infrastructure, belongs to a new generation of high-throughput communication satellites that can meet the requirements of providing satellite internet services, such as Elon Musk's Starlink. The launch marks the 463rd mission of the Long March carrier rocket series.
