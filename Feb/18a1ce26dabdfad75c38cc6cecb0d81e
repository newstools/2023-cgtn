Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, urged Japan not to dispose radioactive water into the ocean before full consultation with stakeholders such as neighboring countries and international agencies. Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks during a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. Noting that this year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of The China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Wang said the Japanese side should take this opportunity to learn from the experiences and lessons, avoid domestic and external distractions, move in the same direction with the Chinese side, and ensure that China-Japan relations move forward steadily on the right track. Unilateralism, decoupling and disruption of industrial and supply chains is not in the interests of any party, he said, adding that the Japanese side should understand the situation and make an independent choice. Disposal of radioactive water into the ocean is related to the marine environment and the health of people, Wang said, urging the Japanese side to handle the issue in a prudent manner. Hayashi said Japan-China cooperation is of great importance to the development and prosperity of each other. Japan is willing to strengthen communication and dialogue with China at all levels, and enhance cooperation in fields such as economic and trade, youth exchanges.
