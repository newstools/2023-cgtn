A century-old tree located in an economic development zone under construction in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has been safely transplanted to local botanical garden.The 104-year-old carambola tree is about 8 meters high, and stood in Shajiao Village, which is the construction site of Lianzhouwan Avenue, one of the main roads in Beihai National Economic and Technological Development Zone.As the tree had decayed roots and lacked nutrients, plant experts recommended that the ancient tree be transplanted to botanical garden where it could receive more scientific conservation."Professional and technical personnel have done a lot of preliminary work, as well as authentication of the survival of the ancient tree after relocation. We will do our utmost to guide the conservation and maintenance of the ancient tree, strengthening fertilizer and water management, pest treatment, restoration, root promotion and other measures to ensure the survival of the transplanted ancient tree," said Mo Xueyan, director of Greening Management Department, Urban Landscape Management Center of Beihai City.
