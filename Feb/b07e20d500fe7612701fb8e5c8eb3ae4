Secretary-General António Guterres laid out the United Nations' priorities in 2023 while addressing the General Assembly session in New York on Monday. The priorities for 2023 include ensuring the right to peace, economic rights and development, working towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), respecting diversity, ensuring gender equality and building inclusive societies. Guterres said "we must correct our course and get out of this dead end" as 2023 faces unprecedented challenges, including ongoing conflicts, a continuing climate crisis, a widening gap between rich and poor, and huge geopolitical divisions that are undermining global solidarity and trust. The UN chief said action is possible but politicians and decision makers "lack the strategic vision to see beyond the short term," urging them to think about the future. "My message today comes down to this: Don't focus solely on what may happen to you today – and dither. Look at what will happen to all of us tomorrow – and act," the UN chief said. The secretary-general's report also aligned with the assembly's preparations for the Sustainable Development Goal Summit in 2023 and the Summit of the Future in 2024. China will continue to support the work of the secretary-general, support the UN in playing a more important role in global governance, and promote the international community to enhance unity and meet challenges together, said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN. China calls for prioritizing the development agenda and committing to maintaining common security, Zhang added. Likewise, President of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly Csaba Korosi also delivered a speech.
