Real Madrid's 5-2 comeback win over Liverpool in the first-leg game of the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 competitions at Anfield reminded both sides' fans of the final five years ago between the same two teams. Back then, at the NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kyiv, Liverpool's goalkeeper Loris Karius made two lethal mistakes that cost his team's game. Real's Thibaut Courtois and Liverpool's Alisson Becker repeated history on Tuesday night. Of course, the two goals that resulted from the two goalies' turnovers didn't decide the result of the game like Karius' underperformance did. Liverpool's loss reflected the gap between them and Real in turning scoring chances into real goals. Can "The Reds" reverse the situation when they visit the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium for the second-leg game on March 15?
