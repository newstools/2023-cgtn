Chelsea outspent another club during the European football winter transfer window that closed on Tuesday. It cost "The Blues" as much as 329.5 million euros (about $358.6 million) to bring multiple players to Stamford Bridge. The transfer of Argentine midfielder Enzo Fernandez from Benfica even set a new Premier LeagueÂ record fee of 121 million euros. One of the major reasons behind Chelsea's struggling performance in the first half of the 2022-23 Premier League campaign is their poor offense, which produced only 22 goals in 20 games. Have the club signed the right players to help them fix that problem and other shortcomings?
