Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has agreed that weapons supplied by the West will not be used on Russian territory, Germany's chancellor said in an interview published on Sunday. "There is a consensus on this point," Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the weekly Bild am Sonntag, adding that such a consensus-based approach "avoids an escalation." Noting that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not threaten to "either me or Germany" during phone talks, Scholz said that Germany will keep a cool head and continue weighing in all the decisions in the future. In recent days, Ukraine's Western allies have pledged to provide it with precision rockets,  missile systems and tanks, which aroused protests and worries about more advanced weaponry. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday in a speech on the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Battle of Stalingrad, that Russia's response to threats will not be limited to the use of armored vehicles. Putin also said that those who are trying to draw European countries into a new war against Russia clearly don't understand that a modern war with Russia will look completely different. Moscow is ready to use all kinds of weapons to respond to Ukraine's attack on Russia, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said Saturday. "Our response can be anything," Medvedev said in response to a corresponding question. He added that the response would be swift, hard and convincing, in accordance with Russia's doctrinal documents, including the country's state policy on nuclear deterrence.
