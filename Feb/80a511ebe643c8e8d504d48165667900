More than 250,000 people demonstrated in Madrid on Sunday in support of the capital region's ailing public health service, which is suffering shortages of staff and equipment. The primary care system in the Madrid area has been under pressure for years due to a lack of resources. So, people are increasingly turning to hospital emergency departments, overwhelming them with patients in a situation also seen in some other regions. Careworkers were among the protesters banging drums and blowing whistles across the capital before converging on the city hall. Organizers claimed almost a million people joined the demonstration to demand that the regional government -- accused of prioritizing private health -- put more resources into the public system.
