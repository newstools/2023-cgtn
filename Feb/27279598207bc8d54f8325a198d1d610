The rabbit's image is deeply loved by people around the world. Rabbits have inspired both Eastern and Western myths. For most Chinese, the animals in the zodiac are seen everywhere during the Spring Festival, especially for those dedicated to cultural heritage protection and education. Hu Xinyu is one of them. In his Countyard Institute, history and tradition are well preserved. They are experienced and practiced by the younger generation through education. Here, they find connections between traditional Chinese culture and themselves. And German philosopher David Bartosch also weighs in on the cultural significance of the rabbit.
