A strong winter storm knocked out power in California, closed interstate highways from Arizona to Wyoming and prompted more than 1,500 U.S. flight cancellations on Wednesday. The second round of snow has been forecast to start around midday on February 23, with the potential to add 10 to 15 inches of snowfall and bring 45 to 50 mph wind gusts.
