The first of the 18 metro trains made by a Chinese company was delivered to Porto Metro in Portugal on Saturday. The 4-car train is on display at the Trindade Metro Station at the center of Porto from Saturday till Tuesday. Co-designed by CRRC Tangshan and its counterpart Porto Metro, the train is lightweight, energy efficient and digitalized per EU standards, said CRRC Tangshan General Manager Tan Mu. Founded in 1881, CRRC Tangshan is one of China's largest makers of trains, high-speed trains and metro vehicles. The new metro train will run at a maximum speed of 80 km/h and can accommodate 244 passengers, including 64 seated travelers. The train meets people's expectations in terms of quality and security, encouraging more people to take public transport, Portuguese Minister of Environment and Climate Action Duarte Cordeiro said. "It is an example of a train that is adapted to Porto Metro's assessments among passengers and workers," said Cordeiro, sitting down on the carriage's seats after visiting the train cab and trying the driver's seat. "This vehicle is the prototype and serves as a reference," said Porto Metro PresidentÂ Tiago Braga. The first train will start service in May, after several trials and tests, and the remaining trains will be delivered by the end of September. Portugal is the first EU country to purchase China-made metro trains. Chinese Ambassador to Portugal Zhao Bentang said that the delivery of the metro trains made by CRRC Tangshan shows the strategic partnership between China and Portugal and the potential of the higher-level cooperation between the two countries. These new carriages will add 6 kilometers and seven stations to the Porto Metro network, making its fleet to 120 vehicles in total. (With input from Xinhua)
