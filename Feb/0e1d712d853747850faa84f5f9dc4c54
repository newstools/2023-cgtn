In China's southeastern Hainan province, rural tourism is fast becoming a buzzword. Hainan is known for its sea breeze, tropical fruits and beautiful scenery. More and more small villages in the province are taking advantage of the natural beauty to bring in visitors. Damao village is one of them. With help from the local government, Damao Ocean Ecological Village has now become a must-go landmark for tourists. Tourism is also creating more job opportunities for local people.
