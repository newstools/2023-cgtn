Boeing marked its final commercial delivery of a 747 – "the Queen of the Skies" – at a ceremony commemorating an aircraft that democratized flying and still serves U.S. presidents. Thousands of current and former employees, celebrities and aviation industry brass converged on Boeing's plant in Everett, Washington, in the northwestern part of the United States, a factory built for the assembly of the original "jumbo jet." The existing fleet is expected to fly for several more decades, but in ceasing 747 production more than 50 years after its maiden flight, Boeing is closing a remarkable chapter in civil aviation history.
