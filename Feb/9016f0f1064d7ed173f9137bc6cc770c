The Shenzhou-15 taikonauts aboard the orbiting China Space Station completed their first spacewalk at 00:16 BJT on February 10. Fei Junlong and Zhang Lu, with support from Deng Qingming inside the station, collaborated to complete all planned tasks. Fei and Zhang have since safely returned to the Wentian lab module. Among their achievements during approximately seven hours of extravehicular activity (EVA), the taikonauts successfully installed extension pumps outside the Mengtian lab module.
