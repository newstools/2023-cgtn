A very large Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) station for south China's Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) completed the construction of a storage tank in Zhuhai on Tuesday. This was announced in a press release by the China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC). The station, named Jinwan "Green Energy Port" as it's located at Gaolan Port in Jinwan District of Zhuhai City, is the largest LNG terminal on the western bank of the Pearl River Estuary. Phase I of the station is already in operation and has been offering continuous, stable clean energy for the GBA since 2013. With five more tanks under construction and expected to be completed by 2024, the station is set to become the largest LNG storage and transport base in South China. Each of the new tanks for phase II has a diameter of 94.2 meters and stands 65.7 meter tall, and can store 270,000 cubic meters of gas. Together, the station can process 7 million tonnes of liquified natural gas annually, equivalent to about 10 billion cubic meters of gaseous natural gas, sufficient to supply nearly 30 million households for one year.
