The CGT, France's largest union, is planning a new day of nationwide demonstrations against the government's planned pension reform on February 16. The announcement came on the heels of Tuesday's general mobilization, which brought together an estimated 757,000 people to demand that the government drop its reform plans. On Tuesday, striking public sector workers also disrupted the country's transport, electricity and local services. On Tuesday evening, after nationwide demonstrations, several unions called on "the entire population to demonstrate even more massively on Saturday, February 11, throughout the territory to say no to this reform." The massive demonstration on Saturday will be the first protest day on a weekend when workers do not need to strike or take time off to march. "On Saturday, everybody can take part in the demonstrations. It needs to be a popular, massive and festive event," Laurent Berger, head of the moderate CFDT union, said on BFM TV. As the country's National Assembly (Parliament) started debating the fiercely contested pension bill on Tuesday, the unions vowed to increase pressure on the deputies. The National Assembly is expected to complete the first reading of the bill by the self-imposed deadline of February 17 - one day after the fifth day of general mobilization. On January 10, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne laid out details of the plan, which would progressively raise the legal retirement age by three months a year from 62 to 64 by 2030, and introduce a guaranteed minimum pension. Starting in 2027, the plan would also require at least 43 years of work to be eligible for a full pension. The plan has aroused strikes since mid-January and the unions are also considering organizing further protest days on March 7 and March 8, when the government's pension reform will be debated in the Senate.
