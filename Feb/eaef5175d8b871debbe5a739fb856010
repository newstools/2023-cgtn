Chinese archaeologists have unearthed seven large tombs at the Taoqu site in Hancheng City, Shaanxi Province, discovering a large number of slab and tubular tiles, pottery fragments, bone tools, as well as some bronze items. The ancient site has been identified as a major city that served as a fiefdom during the late Western Zhou Dynasty (1046-771 BC) and the early Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC), according to the provincial institute of archaeology. The Taoqu site was discovered in the 1980s. Archaeologists have been carrying out exploration and excavation work at the site since May 2020. After two years of research, they found that the site covers an area of about 800,000 square meters, and is divided into high-class residential areas, common residential areas, large and small-sized burial areas, and other zones. Preliminary evidence, including objects inside the tombs, burial customs and history records, suggest that the Taoqu site was a major city that served as a fiefdom during the late Western Zhou Dynasty and the early Spring and Autumn Period, according to experts. The discovery of the tombs has significant academic importance for the study of the history and culture of that period, offering insight into the political systems, geography and ethnic integration of the region.
