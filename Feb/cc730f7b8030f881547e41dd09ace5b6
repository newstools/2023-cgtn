The death toll from Tropical Cyclone Freddy has risen to seven in Madagascar and more than 13,000 people have been displaced, the National Disaster Risk Management Office (BNGRC) said Thursday. Tropical Cyclone Freddy made landfall on the southeastern coast of the Indian Ocean island country Tuesday evening before moving toward the southwest. BNGRC said 68,809 people were affected in seven regions and more than 12,000 houses were flooded or damaged, and 1,206 others were destroyed. The UN said it's working to provide humanitarian support. "We and our humanitarian partners are supporting the government in the response and have started providing assistance to some 7,000 people who were evacuated from their homes," said Stephane Dujarric, the chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
