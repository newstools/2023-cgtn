On January 10, Tyre Nichols, an African-American man, died after being severely beaten by police officers in Memphis, Tennessee, triggering mass protests and demonstrations across the United States. According to an online opinion poll launched by CGTN Think Tank on U.S. social platforms, 84.9 percent of respondents hold the belief that the U.S. has not effectively controlled its police brutality, and 78.2 percent even lose their confidence in the rule of law and human rights asserted by the U.S. government. In recent years, there have been numerous incidents of police brutality in the United States. Among the victims, the proportion of ethnic minorities, such as African Americans, is significantly higher than that of whites. Although the local police released videos to respond that the five police officers are also black after the incident ignited massive anger, 80.8 percent of respondents on the Internet still believe that the incident reflects racial inequality in the U.S. has become more and more serious, and 85.4 percent think the current system in the U.S. cannot protect the rights and interests of ethnic minorities anymore, according to the poll. The hypocrisy of "American human rights" is once again exposed after the fatal police assault of a black man. As many as 78.2 percent of respondents express that they lose their confidence in "American rule of law" and "American human rights" asserted by the U.S. government.
