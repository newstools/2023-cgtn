Marking a climactic end to China's Spring Festival celebrations, the traditional Lantern Festival has transformed the country – from village lanes to city streets – into a sea of bright, dazzling light. In addition to the sparkling, exquisite lanterns lighting up the night sky, a myriad of folk activities, including various intangible cultural heritage performances, also enlivened the festive atmosphere. Symbolizing brightness, warmth and hope, fire is a common element in Chinese folk ceremonies. At a village in Haikou, Hainan Province, villagers, young and old, braved a sea of flames one by one, praying for health and peace in the brand new year. In Putian, Fujian Province, a bonfire was lit, around which people carried a special sedan chair in pairs. To the beats of gongs and drums, performers raised and lowered the sedan chair, jumping, running, and dancing. Called "Baizongjiao," the folk ceremony is considered as a way to ward off evil spirits and pray for a year of good fortune. In Jingjing County of Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, the fireworks proved a real hit. These are not typical fireworks and their techniques are said to date back to China's Qing Dynasty (1644-1912). Called "Nanzhangjing Tiger Fireworks," these flashing fireworks are listed in an extended representative list of China's State-level intangible cultural heritage. In Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Guizhou Province, a dragon dance that boasts a history of over 600 years brought joy to local residents and tourists alike. Listed as a provincial-level intangible cultural heritage, the Longli dragon dance is characterized by the beautiful painted faces of the dancers.
