China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) will be better integrated with transportation, and lane-level navigation service based on the system will be rolled out throughout the country. The plan was initiated on Saturday by China's navigation company Gaode Map and Qianxun Spatial Intelligence Inc., the builder and operator of the BeiDou ground-based augmentation system. Yang Changfeng, chief designer of the BDS and academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said that positioning accuracy evolved from the road-level to the lane-level will bring "revolutionary changes" to people's mobile navigation experience with a single mobile phone. Yang added that high-precision positioning has become a research hotspot of major navigation satellite systems in the globe. The high-precision lane-level navigation based on BeiDou technology is not new, it has been carried out in eight pilot cities, according to Gaode Map. BeiDou's technology has assisted map users to countdown traffic lights by displaying the remaining time of the current traffic light to indicate whether to stop or continue. The navigation company said that it has used BeiDou satellites for positioning over 300 billion times a day as of January, a record high. BDS has outpaced Global Positioning System (GPS) in positioning, becoming the top navigation service provider for the company in China by November, 2022, the company added.
