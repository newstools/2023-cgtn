The 2023 Lantern Festival Gala aired by China Media Group (CMG) on Sunday night highlighted a number of technological innovations in an array of dancing and singing performances. Sunday marked the Lantern Festival, an over 2,000-year-old Chinese tradition observed on the 15th day of the first month on the Chinese lunar calendar which draws Spring Festival celebrations to a conclusion. In accordance with the innovation requirements of "thought + art + technology," CMG realized integrated production of the performances in the gala by means of television and new media, and distributed and disseminated them through multiple media platforms. The immersive effects of the video and audio programs were greatly improved through the application of new technologies such as AR virtual special effects, XR virtual-real fusion production, stereo video and three-dimensional color sound. Large-screen videos, lights, lifting platforms and sound amplifying devices in the studio hall were fully controlled in a centralized way to ensure stage beauty, on-site sound reinforcement and broadcasting safety. The 2023 Lantern Festival Gala was aired simultaneously on CMG's TV, radio and digital channels. About 500 urban cultural squares in cities across the country broadcast the Lantern Festival Gala on 8K ultra-high-definition public large-screen communication platforms. The broadcaster's app adopted two modes of "vertical screen" and "horizontal screen" to broadcast the programs, providing mobile phone users with a more immersive viewing experience.
