Two strong earthquakes struck southern Türkiye on February 6, causing serious casualties in Türkiye and its neighboring country Syria. As of now, around 300,000 people in Syria have been forced to leave their homes, according to the Russian news agency Sputnik. Many planes carrying aid supplies are unable to land at airports in Syria due to the sanctions of the U.S. and the European Union (EU), causing great difficulties for rescue efforts. Please tell us your opinion on the U.S.'s and Western countries' sanctions that impede relief in Syria.
