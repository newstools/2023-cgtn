Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi on Monday expressed confidence that cooperation between China and Thailand will become more fruitful. Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, hailed the friendship between the two countries during talks with visiting Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai in Beijing. As China speeds up its post-pandemic recovery, its advantages as the world's largest market in scale will be fully tapped, and its domestic demand further expanded, Wang noted. "Then the people-to-people exchanges between China and Thailand will become more active and practical cooperation more fruitful," he said. During the talks, Wang also explained the distinctive features of Chinese modernization and the new opportunities it brings to all countries, underscoring that China-Thailand cooperation not only promotes the development of each country but also delivers tangible benefits to the two peoples. Don Pramudwinai said China's modernization of an ultra-large population will create a miracle in human development and inspire Thailand and other small and medium-sized countries to speed up their development process. The two sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis. Wang said neither conflict, imposing sanctions, nor exerting pressure offers a solution, adding that China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace talks and securing a political solution.
