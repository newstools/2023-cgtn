To mark his early career in China's frontier regions, veteran artist Fan Zeng has launched a new collection of his past works in Beijing. The book offers readers a glimpse of sketches and ink paintings the artist made in the country's frontier regions, including Yunnan and Xinjiang, in his prime. The book launch was held at Rongbaozhai, a time-honored art shop in the Chinese capital.
