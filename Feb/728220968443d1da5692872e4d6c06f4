The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady, seen by many as the greatest player of all time in NFL history, announced his retirement in a video he posted on Twitter on Wednesday. "Good morning, guys. I will get to the point. Right away, I'm retiring, for good," Brady said in the clip. He announced retirement once before in February 2022 but changed his mind in two months and returned to the Buccaneers. Having started in all 17 of the team's games during the 2022 regular season with an 8-9 record, Brady helped the Buccaneers reach the playoffs. However, they were knocked out by the Dallas Cowboys in the National Football Conference (NFC) Wild Card Game. "I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning, I figured I'd just press record and let you guys know first," Brady said. "I won't be longwinded. You only get one super emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year, so really thank you guys so much to every single one of you for supporting me." Having played 23 seasons in the league, Brady leads the NFL in passing yards (89,214), passing touchdowns (649), pass completions (7,754) and, most importantly, Super Bowl victories (seven, six in the New England Patriots and one in the Buccaneers). No player or team has ever won that many Super Bowl titles. Despite the disappointing end to the 2022 season, Brady performed well. He completed 490 of his 733 throws, both career highs, for 4,694 yards and 25 touchdowns with nine interceptions. The Buccaneers' failure had more to do with the constant injuries the team had suffered throughout the season. Brady and supermodel Gisele Bundchen agreed to end their 13-year-long marriage in late October 2022. "My family, my friends, my teammates, my competitors â€“ I could go on forever; there's too many," Brady said in the video. "Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream. I wouldn't change a thing. Love you all."
