China plans to launch two meteorological satellites, FY-3G and FY-3F, of the Fengyun-3 (FY-3) series this year, China Meteorological Administration (CMA) said on Tuesday. The FY-3 series marks China's second-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellites, with enhanced functionalities and technical capabilities compared to the first-generation FY-1 series. Upon the launch of the two satellites, China will become the only country in the world that simultaneously operates civil meteorological satellites in four low-Earth orbits – dawn-dusk, morning, afternoon, and inclined orbits, according to the CMA. FY-3G satellite, which is expected to be launched in April, will become China's first satellite for precipitation measurement in an inclined orbit, monitoring disastrous weather systems that can lead to heavy rainfall. FY-3F satellite is scheduled to be launched in August. As a satellite operating in the morning orbit, it will take over the in-orbit mission of the FY-3C satellite, focusing on the surface imaging observations of Earth. China has launched 19 satellites of the Fengyun family, which fall into four types and two generations, continuing to provide services for 126 countries and regions globally, according to the CMA.
