The cutoff in the maiden launch of Japan's new-generation rocket H3 last week was caused by an abnormality in the power system of the rocket's main engine, China Media Group reported citing an investigation report released by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency on Wednesday. The report said an abnormal signal was detected after the ignition of the LE-9 main engine of the rocket's first stage. The countdown was thus halted and the ignition signal was not sent to the two solid rocket boosters, resulting in the termination of the launch. Investigation found that an anomaly in the power system of the LE-9 main engine led to an abnormal signal. It may have been affected by the power status of the rocket body or ground equipment, said the report, adding that no damage was found to the H3 rocket, its payload ALOS-3 land observation satellite or ground equipment. Further investigation will be carried out and measures will be taken for another possible launch attempt before March 10. The H3 rocket, the country's first new medium-lift launcher in three decades, is designed to put government and commercial satellites into orbit and ferry supplies to the International Space Station. It failed to lift off on February 17. The live-streamed event showed the rocket's main engine cut off after the launch countdown had reached zero, leaving the 57-meter rocket on its launch pad at the Tanegashima spaceport.
