Iran imposed sanctions Tuesday on 36 individuals and entities from the European Union and Britain in reaction to similar measures against Tehran over its response to months-long protests. Tehran placed the names on its "sanction list for supporting terrorism and terrorist groups" as well as for "interference in domestic affairs... fomenting violence and unrest," the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement.
