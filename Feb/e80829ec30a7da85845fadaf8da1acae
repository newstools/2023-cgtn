Veronika Kudermetova upset the WTA Qatar Open seedings to defeat American teenager Coco Gauff 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 on Thursday and set up a semi-final with world No. 1 Iga Swiatek. Russian 25-year-old Kudermetova, ranked eighth, needed just over two hours to complete victory over the world No. 4. The reigning French and U.S. Open champion Swiatek reached the last-four when last weekend's Abu Dhabi title winner Belinda Bencic withdrew from their quarter-final. Kudermetova, who will be playing in her second semi-final of the year, is yet to win a set from Swiatek in two previous encounters. Last season, Swiatek kicked off her 37-match win streak in Doha, where she captured her first WTA 1000-level hard-court title. A day after saving two match points to defeat Jelena Ostapenko, second seeded Jessica Pegula had a much easier time in easing to a 6-3, 6-2 win over Beatriz Haddad Maia. Pegula hit 22 winners to 16 unforced errors on Thursday while Haddad Maia made just 12 winners to 20 unforced errors. She will meet Maria Sakkari of Greece for a place in Saturday's final, who beat WTA Finals champion Caroline Garcia of France 6-2, 6-7, 7-6 in an intense game. Meanwhile, China's Zhang Shuai and Yang Zhaoxuan failed to advance to the women's doubles final with their respective partners, as American pair Gauff and Pegula will face off Lyudmyla Kichenok/Jelena Ostapenko in the final on Saturday.
