At least 33 migrants including children were killed and 36 others injured after a bus fell off a cliff in Gualaca in Panama, local media reported Wednesday. The crash happened early on Wednesday when the bus was carrying more than 60 migrants heading towards a shelter located in the western costal province of Chiriqui which borders Costa Rica. "The government of Panama is providing medical attention to the injured," President Laurentino Cortizo said on Twitter. (With input from Reuters)
