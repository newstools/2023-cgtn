The United Nations (UN) General Assembly is the most universal and representative charter body of the UN, and China will continue to fully support the work of the general assembly and the president of the assembly, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Thursday. He made the remarks during a meeting with the visiting president of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly, Csaba Korosi, in Beijing. China firmly upholds the UN-centered international system and the international order based on international law, Qin said. China will hold high the banner of genuine multilateralism, promote overall human progress with Chinese modernization, and bring new opportunities to the world with China's new development, he said, adding that China will take the implementation of the Global Development Initiative as an opportunity to accelerate the achievement of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, jointly promote the Global Security Initiative and join hands to address new challenges to international security. The UN should further play an important role in global governance to maintain peace and security, safeguard fairness and justice, adhere to the principles of inclusiveness and inclusion, place development at the center of the global agenda and bring the benefits of development to all peoples, Qin said. Noting that China is an important partner of the UN, Korosi said the UN attaches great importance to China's influence and leading role as a great power and looks forward to working with China to strengthen multilateralism, improve global governance, advocate dialogue rather than confrontation and unite to address global challenges. The UN has always adhered to the one-China principle and will not deviate from it in any way, he said. The two sides also exchanged views on international hotspot issues of common concern. Regarding the issue of Japan's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, both sides said a responsible attitude should be adopted to protect the only planet on which humanity depends.
