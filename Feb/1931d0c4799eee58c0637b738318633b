BuzzFeed News has reported that residents in eastern Ohio have taken to social media to complain of ill health symptoms and animal corpses following a train derailment. On February 3, a train derailed near the town of East Palestine, spilling hazardous chemicals from its cars. After the train derailment, officials conducted a "controlled burn" of the chemicals, which included vinyl chloride, a known carcinogen. BuzzFeed reports that the EPA has now confirmed that vinyl chloride has entered the Ohio River basin, home to 25 million people. According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, about 3,500 small fish representing 12 species have died since the chemicals spilled into nearby streams.
