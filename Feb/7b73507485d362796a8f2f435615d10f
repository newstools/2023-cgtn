Cities in China's Greater Bay Area will pilot a new travel endorsement policy for talents working on the mainland to travel to Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions. Starting from February 20, eligible candidates can apply for travel endorsements to either Hong Kong or Macao or both. Validity for the endorsements will range from five, three or one year, depending on the candidate's category.
