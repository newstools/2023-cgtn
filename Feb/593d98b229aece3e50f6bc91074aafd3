China's southeast coastal city of Xiamen launched a new air cargo and logistics service to São Paulo of Brazil in cooperation with Ethiopian Cargo & Logistics Services, the logistics arm of Ethiopian Airlines on February 10, 2023. "The new freight transport route will promote the development of aviation logistics between the two BRICS countries." said Ethiopian Airlines Greater China & Mongolia chief representative Tekle G/Yohannes. China is Brazil's largest trading partner and Fujian Province plays a major role. The newly opened cargo route will lower the cost of logistics and further boost the cross-border e-commerce as Xiamen is a major hub for Fujian's trade with Brazil. The cargo route will be operated by a Boeing B777F freighter and has two weekly freighter flights connecting China's Xiamen with São Paulo and Santiago in Brazil via Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The service exports are mainly about high value-added goods like medical and hi-tech products and integrated circuits. "Ethiopian is launching these new flights as it marks the 50th anniversary of the start of its passenger service to China back in 1973", Ethiopian Airlines emphasized in a press release. Xiamen, the host city of the 9th BRICS Summit in 2017, launched the BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution Innovation Center in 2020.
