Kingsley Coman earned Bayern Munich a 1-0 win against Paris Saint Germain (PSG) in their Champions League last-16 first leg match on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Brahim Diaz shot AC Milan to a 1-0 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. Born in Paris and raised at PSG, Coman scored the only goal when Bayern beat the French side in the 2020 Champions League final and he was again the sole scorer as the German champions put one foot into the quarterfinals. PSG, who have now lost five games in all competitions in 2023, held firm in the opening half but were eventually subdued and failed to fight back despite finishing the game with Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi all on the pitch. Christophe Galtier's side now face the prospect of a second elimination in a row in the last 16 on March 8 in Munich, although Mbappe's high-octane display as a second-half substitute will have given them hope. Elsewhere on Tuesday, AC Milan registered a morale-boosting victory over Tottenham Hotspur as Diaz's early strike proved decisive. It was Milan's first knockout fixture at the European elites' stage since the 2013-2014 season, as they played without Mike Maignan, Ismael Bennacer and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Spurs also had a long list of absentees, with Hugo Lloris and Rodrigo Bentancur injured, and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg suspended. Diaz headed in the solo goal just seven minutes into the game when Fraser Forster denied Theo Hernandez at the near post and made a save on Diaz's rebound, but could do nothing to the Spaniard's follow-up.
