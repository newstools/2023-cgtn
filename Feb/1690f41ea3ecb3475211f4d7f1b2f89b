Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has met with visiting UN relief chief Martin Griffiths and discussed humanitarian needs of the Syrian people over last week's quakes, the Syrian presidency said on Tuesday. Griffiths stressed that the United Nations is working to support relief efforts and meet the humanitarian needs of the Syrians as Syria also called for international efforts focusing on helping to rebuild the infrastructure in the country. According to the UN, Syria has agreed to allow UN aid deliveries to opposition-held northwest Syria through two border crossings of Bab Al-Salam and Al Ra'ee from TÃ¼rkiye for three months. In a statement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he welcomed the decision. "As the toll of the 6 February earthquake continues to mount, delivering food, health, nutrition, protection, shelter, winter supplies and other life-saving supplies to all the millions of people affected is of the utmost urgency," Guterres said. "Opening these crossing points - along with facilitating humanitarian access, accelerating visa approvals and easing travel between hubs - will allow more aid to go in, faster," he continued.
