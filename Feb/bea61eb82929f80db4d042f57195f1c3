On February 1, hundreds of thousands of workers, including teachers and civil servants, went on nationwide strike across the UK, the biggest since 2011, calling for better pay and conditions. Thousands of schools closed, train services were paralyzed and delays were expected at airports on this biggest day of industrial action in more than a decade. ThoseÂ simultaneous strikes across multiple industries on February 1 marked an escalation of the unions' protest actions.
