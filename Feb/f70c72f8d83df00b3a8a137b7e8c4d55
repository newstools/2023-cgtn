Scottie Scheffler outdueled Canada's Nick Taylor on Sunday to repeat as Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Phoenix Open champion and overtake Rory McIlroy for the world number one ranking. It was the 26-year-old American's first title since capturing last year's Masters. "It feels pretty good," Scheffler said. Scheffler fired a six-under-par 65 in the final round to complete 72 holes at TPC Scottsdale golf complex on 19-under 265 and defeated Taylor by two strokes for the $3.6 million top prize and his fifth career PGA title. "I'm just proud of how I fought," Scheffler said. "I didn't have my best stuff. I grinded it out today. "I wasn't hitting it good off the tee. My irons didn't feel as sharp. But I played a great round of golf." Scheffler became the seventh back-to-back Phoenix Open winner and the first repeat champion since Japan's Hideki Matsuyama in 2017. He joined McIlroy and Max Homa as the only players to successfully defend PGA titles so far this season. Scheffler won his first PGA title last year at Phoenix to launch an incredible two-month run that included triumphs at Bay Hill and the World Golf Council Match-Play before taking his first major crown at Augusta National.
