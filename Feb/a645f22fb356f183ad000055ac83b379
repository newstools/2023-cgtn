A Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy unit has enhanced its capabilities of searching and rescuing survivors at sea via a drill in the Bohai Sea. The drill was launched with the unit's rescue helicopter taking off after receiving an order to search for shipwreck survivors in designated waters. The crew detected smoke signals and immediately commenced a coordinated rescue operation, hovering the helicopter at low altitude close to the sea surface while descending rescuers with a fast rope. During the drill, the rescuer communicated with winch operators through hand signals, guiding the helicopter to stay around the trapped personnel.
