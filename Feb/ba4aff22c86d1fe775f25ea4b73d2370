The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) revised the magnitude of an earthquake down to 6 from 6.1, which rattled the southern Philippines on Wednesday. The quake, which occurred at 6:44 p.m. local time, hit at a depth of 27 km, about 12 km northeast of New Bataan town in Davao De Oro province, according to an updated notice from the PHIVOLCS. There were no initial reports of damage or casualties but several aftershocks were recorded near the areaÂ later on Wednesday. The institute said the quake was also felt strongly in Davao City and many areas in Mindanao, the Philippines' second-largest island. The Philippines has frequent seismic activity due to its location along the Pacific "Ring of Fire." (With input from Xinhua)
