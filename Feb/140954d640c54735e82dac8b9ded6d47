Li Chunru became a vet forÂ migratory birds in 1982. He used to work at the city hospital. When an unexpected change in his career brought him back to Maying Lake, which is north of Poyang Lake, in his early 30s, his expertise was no longer required. He saved an injured and stranded grey heron by chance, and gradually came to be known among locals as "doctor bird."
