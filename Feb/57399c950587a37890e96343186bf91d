China and Russia reached a consensus on three aspects, Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said on Wednesday regarding his recent visit to Russia. First, the two sides reaffirmed the goals of bilateral relations. At the end of last year, President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin set up plans and deployment for developing bilateral relations in 2023. Both sides organized the work to implement the guidance of the two presidents and have agreed to maintain high-level exchanges and step up strategic cooperation to safeguard the common interests and their own legitimate rights and interests, Wang said. Second, both parties agreed to further boost practical cooperation in various fields. The China-Russia cooperation, which enjoys independent value and its own law of development, has never targeted any third party, nor will it tolerate any third-party interference, Wang said. The two sides agreed to restart the normal exchange of personnel, promote the implementation of key projects in cooperation and host more cultural exchange events, such as Years of Sports Exchanges, to consolidate the public opinion foundation for both countries. Third, both sides would make sure they were on the same page regarding key international and regional issues commonly concerned. Both sides agreed to enhance coordination in multilateral cooperation platforms, such as the United Nations, the BRICS, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The two sides also expressed willingness to communicate on issues including Korean Peninsula matters and the Afghanistan situation, and vowed to jointly maintain peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and surrounding regions, according to Wang.
