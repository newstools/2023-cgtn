On February 6, 2023, an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale struck southern Türkiye in the early hours of the morning local time, and a second major quake measuring 7.8 struck the same area at 1:24 p.m. Cities in southern Türkiye, and northern Syria have been hit hard. CGTN Stringer Neyran Elden drove overnight to Adana, a city near the worst-hit areas, to record what she saw. For Elden, the journey to the quake-hit areas was arduous, and she had to change her travel plans several times due to the heavy snow. When she arrived in Adana, the scene was also very touching. Elden will continue to report on the earthquakes.
