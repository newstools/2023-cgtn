A New Zealander and two other hostages have been freed in Papua New Guinea, the country's prime minister said Sunday, after they were held for a week in rugged highlands by an armed group. "It took us a while but the last three have been successfully returned," Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea James Marape said in a statement.
