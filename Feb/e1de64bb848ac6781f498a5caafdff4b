The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday rebuked U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's claim that China might provide Russia with "lethal support," urging the U.S. to stop shifting the blame and spreading false information. It is the U.S., not the Chinese side that was providing a steady stream of weapons to the battlefield, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin noted at a regular press conference. The U.S. is in no position to giver orders to the Chinese side, Wang pointed out, adding China will never accept the U.S. pointing a finger at China-Russia relations, nor accept coercion and pressure. The spokesperson reiterated that China's position on the Ukraine issue is to facilitate peace through dialogue. "It is clear to the international community who is calling for dialogue and peace and who is fanning the flame and creating confrontation." Wang urged the U.S. side to reflect on what it has done and take more practical actions to ease the situation. China will continue to stand firmly on the side of dialogue, on the side of peace, and play a constructive role in promoting the de-escalation and cooling of the situation, he added.
