Chinese scientists have found a new plant species, namely Astragalus bashanensis, in central China's Hubei Province. The findings have been published in the journal PhytoKeys, sources from the Wuhan Botanical Garden under the Chinese Academy of Sciences said on Tuesday. By comparing the plant with several known Astragalus species, researchers confirmed that it is a new species, with characteristics including a spreading pubescent indumentum on stems and petioles, longer petioles, white bracts, whitish or yellow corolla, longer claw of the keel-petal, hairy pods and smaller seeds. The plant grows on roadside grasslands, on mountain slopes, forest edges or under forest canopies at elevations from 600 to 2,160 meters. The species belongs to the genus Astragalus, which is one of the biggest plant genus in the world that includes 2,500 to 3,000 species. According to the botanical garden, the discovery of the plant species has further enriched people's understanding of the diversity of Astragalus, and has a positive significance for its systematic classification, evolution and development and utilization.
