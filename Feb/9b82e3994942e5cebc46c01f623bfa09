Russian space agency Roscosmos finished the assembly of a Soyuz-2.1a rocket on Saturday. It will carry the Progress MS-22 cargo ship to the International Space Station (ISS). On the rocket was a painting of "The Motherland Calls" statue, the tallest statue of a woman in the world. The rocket is set to launch at 9:15 a.m. Moscow Time (0615 GMT) on February 9 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The cargo ship is not the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft, which was launched back in September 2022. The latter is currently docked to the ISS and scheduled to return to Earth in March, carrying two cosmonauts and one U.S. astronaut.
