The Peruvian Congress on Friday approved the constitutional complaint against former President Pedro Castillo and two former ministers for the alleged crimes of criminal organization, influence peddling and collusion. After more than four hours of debate, the Congress decided to approve the final report with 59 votes in favor, 23 against and three abstentions. This will allow Attorney General Patricia Benavides, who filed the complaint in October 2022, to formalize the investigation and initiate criminal proceedings against Castillo.
