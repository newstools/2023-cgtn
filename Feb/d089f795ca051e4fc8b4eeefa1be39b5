An 80,000-cubic meter liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier was delivered in east China's Shanghai on Saturday, making it the largest river-sea intermodal LNG carrier in the world, said its builder Hudong Zhonghua Shipbuilding (Group) Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation Limited. With a length of 239 meters and a width of 36.6 meters, the Dapeng Princess carrier is the world's largest LNG carrier built for shallow water waterway, said its builder. The load draft is less than 8.5 meters, enabling the ship to travel down rivers and across seas. It can enter the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins even during the dry season, it added. The vessel will be used to transport natural gasÂ and regulate its peak load for Shenzhen City in south China's Guangdong Province. The shipbuilder said it has received nearly 50 orders for LNG vessels, with production scheduled until 2028. The company plans to deliver four LNG ships this year. China remained the world's leading shipbuilder in 2022, grabbing the largest market share in global output, new and holding orders, according to data released by the country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in January. The country has made breakthroughs in LNG tankers in 2022. Chinese companies received 55 LNG carrier orders in the past year, accounting for over 30 percent of the world's total, a record high for the country. (With input from Xinhua)
