The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Thursday warned the U.S. to stop spying on China by sending vehicles in close proximity to China. The ministry's spokesperson Mao Ning made the remarks at a regular press briefing when she responded to reports that a U.S. unmanned vehicle for collecting underwater information found in Namibia was suspected of a spy ship and the latest data issued by a Chinese think tank that the U.S. military conducted 64 close-in spying flights over the South China Sea in January this year. Mao said that most surveillant and spying activities around the world have been conducted by the U.S. and it has long been gathering intelligence in other countries. She noted that the U.S. side frequently sends vessels and aircrafts to conduct close-in reconnaissance on China, which seriously endangers China's national security and undermines regional peace and stability. China has repeatedly expressed serious concern that the U.S. side should immediately stop such provocative behavior, she stressed. Meanwhile, Mao reiterated that the unintended entry of a Chinese civilian airship into U.S. airspace was caused by force majeure. She refuted the U.S.'s claim that it was a spy balloon, saying it is part of the U.S.'s information and public opinion warfare against China.
