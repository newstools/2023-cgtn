Fishermen are embracing the harvest season for pond smelts at Bosten Lake in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China's largest inland freshwater lake and the biggest fishery base. As the fishing net was pulled out from under the icy lake surface, Li gained his first harvest of the pond smelts. The fish would then be transported to the shore for sale. In order to protect other fish species, the local fishery management staff will conduct irregular inspections on the lake area, and timely rescue and release fish species and other economic fish fry (accidentally caught by fishermen) to ensure the sustainable fish stock in the Lake.
