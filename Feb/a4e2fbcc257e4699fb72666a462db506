In response to remarks by U.S. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby, who declared that the U.S. does not intend to return the debris and equipment of China's unmanned civilian airship, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that the Chinese government will continue to resolutely safeguard its legitimate and lawful rights and interests. Mao stressed that the airship's entry into U.S. airspace due to force majeure was totally unexpected and accidental, and posed no threat to U.S. personnel or national security. She added that the U.S. should have handled such an incident in a calm, professional and non-military manner.
