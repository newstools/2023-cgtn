NASA plans to launch its SpaceX Crew-6 mission to the International Space Station (ISS) on February 26, according to the agency. The liftoff is targeted for 2:07 a.m. Eastern Time on February 26 from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mission is NASA's sixth crew rotation mission with SpaceX to the space station, and the seventh flight of Dragon spacecraft with humans aboard. The Crew-6 mission will carry NASA astronauts Stephen Bowen and Warren "Woody" Hoburg, as well as United Arab Emirates astronaut Sultan Alneyadi and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev to the orbital outpost. The crew will dock the space station's Harmony module about 23 hours after liftoff, according to NASA. The crew entered their two-week quarantine period beginning Sunday in preparation for their flight to the ISS.
