A growing portion of Americans think the United States has provided too much support to Ukraine, as the Biden administration and other Western allies ramp up their backing of the country in the Russia-Ukraine conflict in recent weeks, according to a new Pew Research Center poll. More than a quarter (26 percent) of Americans said the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine, an increase of six percentage points since last September and of 19 points since March 2022, shortly after the conflict began last year, the survey revealed on Tuesday. "While 31 percent say it is giving the right amount and 20 percent would like to see the U.S. give Ukraine additional assistance," said the poll, conducted January 18 to 24 among 5,152 U.S. adults. "This shift in opinion is mostly attributable to the growing share of Republicans who say the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine. Today, 40 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents hold this view, up from 32 percent in the fall and much higher than the 9 percent who held this view in March of last year," said the survey. The U.S. has provided billions of dollars to Ukraine to support its military since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in February 2022. And it is readying over $2 billion worth of military aid for Ukraine, including "longer-range rockets for the first time as well as other munitions and weapons," two U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday.
