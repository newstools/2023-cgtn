At least nine Palestinians were killed and 97 others were injured on Wednesday during armed clashes with Israeli soldiers who raided the northern West Bank city of Nablus, Reuters reported, citing Palestinian officials. The Palestinian Health Ministry said earlier the injuries include three journalists, following clashes with the soldiers after an Israeli army force stormed the city. Local sources and eyewitnesses said Israeli troops backed by armored vehicles stormed the outskirts of the old city of Nablus and surrounded a house to arrest several Palestinians wanted by Israel.
