The world's largest double-ended roll-on/roll-off (RORO) passenger ship, 230.5 meters long and 30.8 meters wide, with a service speed of up to 20.8 knots, was delivered to its new owner in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province, on Tuesday. Upon delivery to the shipowner, English shipping company P&O Ferries, the ship will operate in the English Channel, mainly between the Port of Dover in southeastern UK and the Port of Calais in northern France. The hybrid ship, which has a capacity of 1,500 passengers and over 700 vehicles of different types, can switch its propulsion mode between fuel and battery as needed with one button, minimizing air pollution. The ship is equipped with 1,160 large-capacity batteries assigned in four battery rooms. The total capacity can reach 8.8 megawatt-hours (MWh), which is equivalent to the total capacity of 150 electric cars, China Media Group (CMG) reported. The batteries have two charging modes. One is to use the power supply on the dock when it docks for passenger and cargo loading, and the other is to charge with the electricity generator on the ship. The ship can recycle the excess electric energy while sailing and store them in large-capacity batteries. Another highlight of the RORO ship is that the structure of its bow and stern is completely symmetrical and can realize two-way navigation. Both the bow and stern have a wheelhouse with the same operation equipment. The crew can pilot the ship from the two wheelhouses, respectively. Zhou Xuhui, deputy general manager of Guangzhou Shipyard International Company Ltd. under the China State Shipbuilding Corporation Ltd., said the design enables the ship to turn 360 degrees in situ, effectively shortening the time the ship enters and leaves the port and improving the operation efficiency.
