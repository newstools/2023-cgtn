The Chinese mainland supports sharing development opportunities with farmers and fishers of the Taiwan region, a senior Taiwan affairs official of the Chinese mainland said on Wednesday. Seeking peace, development, exchanges and cooperation are the common aspirations of compatriots across the Taiwan Straits, Song Tao, head of both the Taiwan Work Office of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, told a delegation led by Huang I-cheng, chairman of the association for agriculture and fishery exchange, development and investment across the Taiwan Straits. The mainland has always attached great importance to the appeal from farmers and fishers in Taiwan to resume the entry of certain agricultural and aquatic products into the mainland, said Song. "When the prerequisites of inspection and quarantine standards are met, we will coordinate with the relevant authorities to facilitate [the re-entry]," he said. The mainland has suspended the entry of certain agricultural and aquatic products from Taiwan since March 2021 after harmful organisms and prohibited chemicals were detected. During Wednesday's meeting in Beijing, Huang conveyed the hope of farmers and fishers on the island that the mainland can resume the entry of these products. He said he would work with those on the island to contribute more to cross-strait exchanges and cooperation and the peaceful development of cross-strait relations.
