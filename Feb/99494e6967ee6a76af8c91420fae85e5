A couple and their son have been pulled alive from the rubble in the city of Antakya, more than 12 days after a powerful earthquake struck in the region. Tragically, the 12-year-old boy later died from his injuries. More than 45,000 people have died and millions have been left without proper shelter in the aftermath of the earthquakes that hit TÃ¼rkiye and Syria on February 6.
