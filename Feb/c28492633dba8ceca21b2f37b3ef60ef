The Beijing municipal work report calls on higher standards for opening-up in upgrading the city's "two zones" in 2023. The "two zones" refer to a national integrated demonstration zone for greater openness in the service sector, and a pilot free trade zone characterized by scientific and technological innovation. The zones offer preferential policies for both foreign and domestic investors in sectors such as science, culture, entertainment, finance, tourism and healthcare. Authorities say they will continue to concentrate on institutional innovation with advanced international rules and practices as a benchmark to maximize market vitality.
