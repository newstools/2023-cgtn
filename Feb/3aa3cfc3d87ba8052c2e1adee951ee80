The alligator gar was recently included on the List of Key Invasive Alien Species of China. It is a giant freshwater carnivorous fish in North America with a body length of up to 3 meters, making it the largest species in the gar family. The most distinctive feature of the alligator gar is its crocodile-like muzzle and sharp teeth in the upper and lower jaws. It is fierce in nature and basically all creatures in the water have fallen prey to the alligator gar. They eat a lot, and can eat dozens of kilograms of freshwater fish a day, which is equivalent to their body weight. The alligator gar are highly reproductive and their eggs are poisonous, however, natural predators such as American crocodiles, large raptors and otters in their home range, thus controlling their population growth. Twenty years ago, the alligator gar were introduced to China as an ornamental fish, where they have almost no natural predators. Unfortunately, some people breed them and then randomly release them into the wild. The alligator gar has hard scales all over its body, which can avoid many fierce predators. When it enters natural water bodies, local fish will be preyed upon in large numbers, thus leading to the reduction of aquatic biodiversity. Therefore, it has a negative impact on aquaculture, fishery resources and biodiversity in China. At present, its population can only be reduced through artificial fishing. In addition, public education should be strengthened to avoid release and stop its spread at source. (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
