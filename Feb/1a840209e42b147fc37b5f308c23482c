Andrew Hsia, vice chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) party, will lead a delegation to visit the Chinese mainland and attend relevant cross-strait exchange activities from February 8 to 17, said Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, on Monday. Welcoming Hsia's visit, Zhu said the mainland is willing to strengthen exchanges and consolidate and enhance mutual trust with the Chinese KMT party on the political basis of commonly upholding the 1992 Consensus and opposing "Taiwan independence." Zhu also said the mainland stands ready to deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields, aimed at jointly promoting the development of cross-strait relations and the relationship between the Communist Party of China and the Chinese KMT party, safeguarding the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits and improving the interests and well-being of the compatriots on both sides of the straits.
