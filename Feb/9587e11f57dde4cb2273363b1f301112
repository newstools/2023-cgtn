John Henry, owner of the Premier League's traditional powerhouse, Liverpool, said in an interview with the Boston Sports Journal on Sunday that he won't sell the club. "I know there has been a lot of conversation and quotes about Liverpool, but I keep to the facts: We merely formalized an ongoing process," Henry said. "Will we be in England forever? No. Are we selling Liverpool? No. Are talking with investors about Liverpool? Yes. Will something happen there? I believe so, but it won't be a sale. Have we sold anything in the past 20-plus years?" In November 2022, the Fenway Sports Group (FSG), which took over Liverpool in 2010, said they would consider bringing in investors if it was in the club's "best interest." Liverpool's chairman Tom Werner then added that there's no urgency to completing any potential deal. According to ESPN, despite Werner's words, the FSG enlisted investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to help find a potential buyer last November. It cost the FSG about 300 million pounds (about $360.2 million) to purchase Liverpool 13 years ago. The latest sale of a big club in the top English league was the $5.4 billion takeover of Chelsea by Todd Boehly from Roman Abramovich in May 2022. It's hard to imagine that Liverpool, which have a much more glorious history than Chelsea, will be sold cheaper than Chelsea. There is one thing that the two clubs share in common this season: They are both struggling on the field. Liverpool are currently eighth on the standings table, with 35 points after 22 games. Meanwhile, Chelsea are 10th, with 31 points after 23 games. Neither is even close to securing qualification for the UEFA Champions League next season. Chelsea lost to Borussia Dortmund 1-0 in the first-leg game of the Champions League Round of 16 competitions at Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, Germany, last week, and Liverpool will host Real Madrid at Anfield in Liverpool, England on Tuesday.
