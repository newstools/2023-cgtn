The United States has a longstanding practice of exerting frequent long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, which severely harms the international political and economic order and the rule of law, according to a report published on Friday. "The United States has a longstanding practice of exerting frequent long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, including both its allies and countries with which it has hostile or strained relations. In recent years, the practice has kept expanding in scope, with U.S. 'arms' stretching longer and longer," said the report, published on the website of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Examining cases of U.S. abuse of long-arm jurisdiction, this report, titled "The U.S. Willful Practice of Long-arm Jurisdiction and its Perils," lays bare the severe harm it has done to the international political and economic order and the international rule of law.
