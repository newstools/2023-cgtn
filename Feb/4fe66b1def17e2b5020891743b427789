The Israeli forces have killed a number of armed fighters during a raid on a refugee camp near the city of Jericho on Monday aimed at "capturing suspected Hamas militants," the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet security agency said in a joint statement. The raid was part of an operation to apprehend suspects involved in a shooting attack on a nearby restaurant last month, the statement added. At least five Palestinians were killed in the clashes early Monday morning, Palestine's WAFA news agency reported.
