Heavy rainfall in southeast Brazil since last weekend has killed at least 50 people and displaced thousands, according to the latest data from local authorities. At least 38 people remain missing, while more than 3,000 have been forced to flee their homes, a statement from Sao Paulo's state government said. It said more rainfall is expected in the coming days as humidity from the Atlantic Ocean and the Amazon rainforest creates conditions for "moderate to heavy showers." On Thursday, a Brazilian Navy ship arrived in the coastal city of Sao Sebastiao, some 200 kilometers from the metropolis of Sao Paulo, to help rescue victims.The Navy's multipurpose aircraft ship, its largest vessel, will serve as an emergency field hospital and is equipped with helicopters and landing vehicles, as well as hospital beds.
