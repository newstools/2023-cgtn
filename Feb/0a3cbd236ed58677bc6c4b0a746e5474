China outlined key tasks for comprehensively promoting rural vitalization for 2023, including ensuring the production and supply of grain, expanding the achievements of poverty alleviation, as well as increasing farmers' incomes, according to a press conference on Tuesday. The press conference came after the launch of this year's No. 1 central document, which is the first policy statement released by China's central authorities each year, with work on agriculture and rural areas being high on the agenda for 20 consecutive years. Despite a global food crisis in 2022, China has secured a bumper harvest 19 years in a row, with grain output hitting a new record of 686.5 billion kilograms. The supply of meat, eggs, milk, fruits, vegetables and fish is sufficient, and prices are stable throughout the year. China eradicated absolute poverty in 2020. The country has kept the bottom line of not returning to poverty on a large scale. The document this year called for efforts to narrow the income and development gaps between rich and less affluent regions. Farmers' income increased steadily, with the annual disposable income per capita growing by 4.2 percent to 20,133 yuan ($2,955). Among the disposable income, wages accounted for the largest share at 41.96 percent. In 2022, the number of migrant workers reached 32.8 million.
