A makeshift hospital has been set up on a warship to get medical help to residents of Iskanderun and nearby areas. Those who survived the quake can visit pediatricians, surgeons, orthopedists and get X-rays, ultrasounds, electrocardiograms or injections on the ship. The floating hospital has a capacity of 300 beds, and more than 2,000 people have so far been able to access medical treatment there.
