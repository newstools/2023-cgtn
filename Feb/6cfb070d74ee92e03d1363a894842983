A digital gallery recently opened to the public in Fahai Temple, which sits at the foot of Cuiwei Mountain in the suburbs of Beijing, displaying the fine details of a 600-year-old wall painting found in the temple thanks to the 4K technology. The art gallery, occupying an exhibition area of 1,800 square meters, offers visitors an immersive experience of the Ming Dynasty (1368â€“1644) artwork through giant LED screens and a dome screen. The tour lasts around four hours. Visitors can take a close look at each of the 77 figures in the wall painting, and get to know the history of Fahai Temple and how the painters created this masterpiece. Fahai Temple, along with the wall painting in the Great Buddha's Hall, was completed in 1443. Painters used bright colors and slender strokes to portray 77 vivid characters, including men and women, both young and old, and Buddha figures and ghosts. In order to better preserve the art treasures, the Great Buddha's Hall is enveloped in darkness. Visitors can only enter the hall in small groups at certain times of the day, following a tour guide to view the paintings by faint torch light. The digital art gallery, themed around Fahai Temple and its wall paintings, gives a second life to the artwork in the darkness. Detailed introductions, scaled-up displays of the original works, and high-definition videos offer visitors a comprehensive overview of the temple and its art treasures.
