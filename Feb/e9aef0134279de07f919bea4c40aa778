The Milwaukee Bucks beat the Los Angeles Clippers 119-106 at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, California, on Friday, extending their winning streak to 10 games. The Bucks, who played back-to-back, rested Khris Middleton for load management while the Clippers missed Kawhi Leonard (right knee injury management) and Nicolas Batum (lower back spasms). The Clippers continued their previous defensive arrangement on Giannis Antetokounmpo by having Ivica Zubac, a seven-footer, guard him. Though Antetokounmpo took his second shot from downtown and made it, Zubac gave him a hard time in the first quarter during which he missed six of his nine field goals (FGs). The rest of the Bucks didn't do enough to support the "Greek Freak" in the first period as the team committed seven turnovers. Though the Clippers shot as poorly as 5-for-16 in jumpers, they exploited the Bucks' mistakes well to go for many easy points via fast break and led 27-22 after the first quarter. Brook Lopez stood out for the Bucks in the second quarter and scored 14 of his 22 points in this period. He could score over the heads of the opponentsâ€™ defenders who are smaller than him and make 3-pointers where Zubac is to slow to cover. Though Lopez is no quicker than Zubac on the defensive end and thus was targeted by the Clippers in the middle range, the Clippers failed to punish him enough on that front. When Antetokounmpo came back in the second half, he altered his way of launching attack in the correct way. Instead of challenging Zubac's defense right from front, Antetokounmpo shot more hooks and kicked the ball out more to find open shooters. The Bucks went 9-for-21 behind the arc in the second half. Friday's game was long gone when there were about five minutes left in the fourth quarter. Until then, Paul George shot 8-for-23 from the field to get 19 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. 18 of his attempts were jumpers and 11 were from outside. Fairly speaking, it is difficult for anyone to charge the rim protected by Lopez, not mention that you have to beat Jrue Holiday first on the perimeter. However, it is still disappointing for a star scorer like George to earn no free throws at all after playing nearly 32 minutes on the floor. Norman Powell contributed most of the Clippers' offensive aggressiveness in Friday's game by making nine of the 10 free throws he earned. Other games on Friday (away teams come first): Cleveland Cavaliers 118-107 New Orleans Pelicans The Cavaliers secured their fifth consecutive win on Friday while ending the three-game winning streak of the Pelicans at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans, Louisiana. Donovan Mitchell, Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley dominated the Pelicans from both the outside and inside. Mitchell scored the court-high 30 points for the Cavaliers. Mobley and Allen both had double-doubles, combining to get 48 points and 24 rebounds after going 21-for-26 in the paint. The two also had four blocks and nine offensive rebounds. The Cavaliers led by as many as 25 points (101-76) in the third quarter. Oklahoma City Thunder 138-129 Portland Trail Blazers In the contest between two top guards from different generations on Friday night, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) of the Thunder outperformed Damian Lillard of the Trail blazers at the Moda Center in Portland, Oregon. SGA shot more free throws (18-for-19) than FGs (13-for-16) to drop 44 points and seven assists. 13 of his attempts took place under the hoop and he made 12 of them. By contrast, Lillard had 38 points and nine assists after draining six triples. The Thunder trailed by two points (105-103) after the first three quarters, but they forced seven turnovers by the Trail Blazers in the final period. Three of them came from Lillard. From 10:01 to 5:22, the Thunder had a 16-2 run to gain the lead and didn't let it go again. Dallas Mavericks 122-114 Sacramento Kings The Mavericks established a 20-point lead (45-25) after the first quarter at the Golden 1 Center in Sacramento, California, on Friday. The Kings worked hard in trying to come back in the following three quarters. They outscored the Mavericks in every period, but not enough in total to reverse the situation. De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis combined to get 51 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists for the Kings. Fox even had 15 points in the fourth quarter alone. Kyrie Irving struggled with his FG shooting, but made all of the 12 free throws he earned to get 25 points and 10 assists, keeping the Mavericks among the top four in the Western Conference before Luka Doncic returns.
