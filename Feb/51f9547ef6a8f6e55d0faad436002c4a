Last September, taikonauts Chen Dong and Liu Yang completed their first extravehicular activities (EVAs) with the support of taikonaut Cai Xuzhe inside the space station lab module Wentian. Only 17 days after the first spacewalk, the taikonauts conducted their second EVAs, during which they installed a handle and had an extravehicular rescue drill.
