Veteran Chinese artist Fan Zeng launched a new book in Beijing, a collection of his sketches and ink paintings in his prime in the country's frontier regions. The book launch was held at Rongbaozhai, a time-honored art shop in the Chinese capital. "Here are my works from 45 years ago, where some of my friends selected sketches from the prime of my life. This is only a small part of my sketching work," Fan said at the launch ceremony. Issued by Rongbaozhai Publishing House, the book was compiled by Fan Xiaohui, the daughter of Fan Zeng. It is divided into three sections covering the artist's line drawings of plants in Yunnan from 1978, sketches of the characters he encountered in Xinjiang, and ink paintings he made of the ethnic Dai people in Yunnan. Fan Zeng is considered to be one of the leading contemporary Chinese ink and wash painters and calligraphers. His works are full of emotion and a vividness that reflects the natural world. Through this sketchbook, readers will be able to appreciate his approach toward art and life.
