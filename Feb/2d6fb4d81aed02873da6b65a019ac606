China's centrally-administered state-owned enterprises (SOEs) raked in an operating revenue of 39.6 trillion yuan ($5.8 trillion) in 2022, an increase of 9.1% year on year, reflecting the country's continued promotion of the sector's comprehensive high-quality development. At a media conference on Thursday, the State Council's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) said central SOEs achieved a total profit of 2.6 trillion yuan last year, up 6.2 percent from the previous year. Over the past 10 years, the total assets of China's central SOEs jumped to 81 trillion yuan from 31.4 trillion yuan. Meanwhile, total profits have increased to 2.6 trillion yuan from 1.3 trillion yuan over the same period, marking improvements in both the quality and efficiency of the enterprises, said Zhang Yuzhuo, chairman of the SASAC. This year, China is targeting a growth rate of profits among central SOEs that is higher than the country's GDP growth, according to Zhang. To meet the people's needs for a better life is an unswerving goal of central SOEs, said Zhao Shitang, vice chairman of the SASAC. He added that central SOEs will strive to ensure energy supply and stabilize energy prices, provide support to small- and medium-sized enterprises and take the lead in promoting green transition.
