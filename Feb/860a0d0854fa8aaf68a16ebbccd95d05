On February 3, a Norfolk Southern Railways train carrying toxic chemicals derailed, causing an environmental disaster. Residents of East Palestine, Ohio State, said they were induced to sign agreements to "hold harmless from and against any and all legal claims" when the company came to people's homes to test air pollutants. The company has asked hundreds of residents to sign the agreement, but so far all have refused.
