European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday said the EU is turning up the pressure with a 10th package of sanctions against Russia that would cut off goods worth 11 billion euros ($11.77 billion) as the Russia-Ukraine conflict has continued for almost a year. She said the 10th package of sanctions includes new bans on industrial goods exports, and the block is proposing further export restrictions on tech products found on the battlefield, including sanctioning Iranian entities linked to Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. "We will further restrict the export of dual-use goods and advanced tech goods. We propose controls on 47 new electronic components that can be used in Russian weapons systems, including drones, missiles, helicopters. And on specific rare earth materials and thermal cameras. With this, we have banned all tech products found on the battlefield,"  Von der Leyen said. "We are making Russia pay." On top of that, the EU is also expanding its sanction list related to Russia, adding almost 100 individuals and entities "responsible for military activities, political decisions, propaganda, and disinformation." "Next week, we will organize a Sanctions Coordinators Forum to strengthen enforcement," Von der Leyen said, adding that EU Sanctions Envoy David O'Sullivan is reaching out to third countries to address circumvention of sanctions. High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell later also vowed to continue to increase pressure on Russia for as long as needed "until Ukraine is liberated from the brutal Russian aggression." Moscow has not yet responded to the new EU sanctions.
