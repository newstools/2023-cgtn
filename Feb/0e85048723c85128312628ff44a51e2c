The second phase of China's deep space observation radar facility, dubbed the "China Compound Eye," started construction Tuesday in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality. The China Compound Eye facility will be used to observe and capture high resolution images of deep space objects, including asteroids, the moon and Earth-like planets, serving the country's near-Earth asteroid defense work and planetary science research. Its construction comprises three phases, with the first phase consisting of four 16-meter-diameter radars completed last December. After the completion of its third phase, the facility is expected to have more than 100 radars.
