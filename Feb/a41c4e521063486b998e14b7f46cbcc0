The National Museum of China has launched a special exhibition in celebration of the Year of Rabbit. It showcases the culture and traditions of the Chinese zodiac and Chinese New Year from multiple perspectives. Titled "Celebrating the Year of the Rabbit: 2023 Chinese New Year Exhibition," the show presents over 80 sets of artifacts collected by the museum. The collections span from the Shang Dynasty dating back to 1600 B.C. to the early 20th century. Diverse in genre and made from various materials, they include different forms of art, such as sculpture, ornament, calligraphy, and painting. The curator of the exhibition Gao Xiuqing explained that this exhibition focuses on two themes â€” the culture of the rabbit in the Chinese zodiac and traditional Chinese New Year culture. Many rabbit-inspired artifacts are on display. Among them is the rabbit head sculpture from the Haiyantang at the Old Summer Palace, a white-jade cup featuring rabbit-shaped handles, and a miniature jade rabbit. "At the front of the exhibition, we can see a small, crystal-clear jade rabbit. It's only two centimeters in length. Although small, it's exquisitely carved," Gao said. "This little white rabbit is running, showing its beautiful posture. It represents the agility and sensitivity of the rabbit." In addition, five sets of multimedia displays are set up in different sections of the exhibition hall, enhancing the visual and auditory experience, and providing a festive atmosphere. Of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac, the rabbit is seen as an auspicious animal that brings good fortune. It's a symbol of agility and speed and has long been respected and even worshiped by people over the centuries. According to an ancient Chinese legend, the Jade Rabbit accompanied the Moon Goddess Chang'e to the Lunar Palace. Over time, rabbits became synonymous with the moon and were regarded as a symbol of longevity.
