The Italian coast guard recovered the bodies of eight migrants and rescued 42 people during an operation in the central Mediterranean off the island of Lampedusa on February 2. The video shows the survivors packed in a small open fishing boat, which was adrift with a non-functioning motor. All on board were soaking wet, cold and dehydrated, according to the news agency ANSA. Survivors said they were among some 200 migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan African countries.
