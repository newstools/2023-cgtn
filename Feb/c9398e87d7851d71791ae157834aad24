China opposes unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law and are not authorized by the UN Security Council on Chinese companies, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Thursday as a response to the possible sanctions posed by the International Group of Seven (G7) on Chinese companies, which it claims are aiding Russia's military operations in Ukraine. Mao said that China's position on the Ukraine crisis has always been consistent and clear. China has always adhered to the "Four Should" and "Four Must" principles proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping to actively promote peace talks in an objective and just manner and has played a constructive role in easing the tension. She added that China has always been opposed to unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law and are not authorized by the UN Security Council, and China will take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies firmly. President Xi brought up the "Four Must" principles at a virtual summit with leaders of France and Germany last March. He stressed that on the Ukraine issue, China maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be fully observed, the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously, and all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis must be supported. In his Keynote Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum last June, Xi put forward "Four Should" principles to handle a series of tough issues facing the world: First, we should embrace solidarity and coordination and jointly maintain world peace and stability; Second, we should reach out to each other and jointly promote sustainable global development; Third, we should tide over difficulties together and jointly pursue win-win cooperation; Fourth, we should be inclusive and jointly expand openness and integration. It's reported that the G7 member states are discussing whether to put sanctions on companies of China, Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that they believe are providing Russia with parts and technology that have military purposes, and the companies that might be included in the sanction list have not been decided yet. G7 is an intergovernmental political forum consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the U.S.
