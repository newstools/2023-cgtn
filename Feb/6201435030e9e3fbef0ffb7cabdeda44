China appreciates Belgium's advocacy of openness and cooperation, and opposition to "decoupling" in global supply chains, senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said on Saturday. During a meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo on the sidelines of the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, Wang said China has seen a robust economic recovery after it has succeeded in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, which will bring greater opportunities to cooperation between China and Belgium. "We appreciates Mr Prime Minister's advocacy of openness and cooperation, and opposition to 'decoupling,' which has been a sensible and responsible voice from a European country," said Wang, according to a read-out of the meeting released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. China is ready to work with Belgium to safeguard an open and orderly international trading environment, instead of a divisive and chaotic one, he said. Noting that Belgium is a founding member of the European Union (EU), Wang said he looks forward to the country's continued constructive role in developing China-EU relations. De Croo said Belgium and China have always been in close communication and exchanges. The Belgian side attaches great importance to its relations with China, he said, adding that the country is committed to the one-China policy. He voiced hope that the two countries will boost cooperation in economy and trade, civil aviation and new energy.
