China will release a key document that will encourage Russia and Ukraine to go back to the negotiation table and join hands with the international community to seek political solutions to the ongoing crisis, according to a senior Chinese diplomat. Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks to the press on Thursday after he wrapped up his recent tour to the 59th Munich Security Conference in Germany. He said after he met with leaders and foreign ministers of more than 10 countries during his trip to Munich and Moscow, he learned that although many sides hold different or conflicting views of the Ukraine crisis, they all agreed to solve the dispute through dialogues, and they expect China to play a more significant role in the process. "China will release a document about political solutions to the Ukraine crisis, reiterate China's stances while incorporating reasonable concerns of various countries, and try our best to reach the greatest common divisor among international communities," Wang said. The crisis takes place in Europe but affects the entire world. It cannot go on forever, and China supports the EU to play a more active and constructive role in bringing Russia and Ukraine back to the negotiation table, he added. The Ukraine crisis is not what China would like to see, and everything China has been doing is to facilitate peace talks, he said, adding that since the conflict broke out, China has not chosen to be a bystander or added fuel to the fire, and it has been against exploiting the crisis. Wang said China is willing to join hands with all parties to continue the efforts for realizing peace at an early date.
