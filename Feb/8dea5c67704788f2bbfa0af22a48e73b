China is ready to strengthen economic, trade and technology cooperation with Austria, senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said on Saturday during a meeting with Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Wang, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said China is willing to strengthen exchanges with Austria at all levels to deepen mutual trust and friendship. Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said he hopes the Austrian side adheres to the one-China principle and supports openness and inclusiveness. Facing global challenges, the world needs openness, interconnectivity and multilateralism instead of seclusion, isolation and unilateralism, he added. Schallenberg said the Austrian side is firmly committed to the one-China policy, which is one of its diplomatic norms. Austria is ready to cooperate with China with an open mind, opposes decoupling and firmly supports globalization. China has an important international influence and is expected to play a greater role in the Ukraine issue and promote the de-escalation of the situation, he said. Wang stressed that the crisis in Ukraine should not continue any longer and all parties should think deeply about how to achieve a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities. China has always insisted on urging peace and promoting talks, and will continue to make constructive efforts.
