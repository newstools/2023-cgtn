PetroChina, China's largest oil and gas producer, said on Monday that its Pengshen-6 oil well has reached a depth of 9,026 meters, smashing the record for deepest vertical well in Asia.Located in southwest China's Sichuan Province, the well has complex geological conditions and exploration work faced multiple challenges, including high temperature, pressure and sulfur content.The 9,026 meters of drilling work marks a new record of the deepest vertical oil well in Asia, said Ma Yong, deputy director of engineering technology department at the PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gasfield Company. It will provide engineering support for the ultra-deep oil and gas exploration, and lay the foundation for the 10,000-meter-deep scientific exploration well program to be launched in 2023, Ma added. The Sichuan Basin owns rich deep oil and gas resources with large storage. Since 2011, the company has drilled eight wells of over 8,000 meters and two wells of over 9,000 meters. Among them, the Shuangyu 001-H6 well in the southwestern Sichuan Basin has reached a depth of 9,010 meters, setting a record for the deepest onshore gas well in China.
