The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy will recruit female cadet pilots to fly carrier-based aircraft for the first time in its recently launched recruiting program. The navy will expand the selection scope of pilot corps from ordinary high school students and military school graduates to civilian college students and college soldiers and female pilot cadets. The selection targets are science and engineering graduates who are enrolled in the first batch of undergraduate courses or special recruitment courses, among which civilian college students must be fresh graduates.
