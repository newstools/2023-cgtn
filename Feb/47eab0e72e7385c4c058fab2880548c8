Egypt looks forward to attracting more investments from China through further improving the investment environment in the most populous Arab country, Egyptian officials and business leaders told a recent seminar held in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. The China-Egypt Entrepreneur Seminar, hosted on Monday by the Egyptian Businessmen's Association, was attended by China's Ambassador to Egypt, Liao Liqiang, and about 130 representatives from Chinese and Egyptian enterprises, financial institutions, as well as trade and investment promotion agencies. The seminar focused on promoting Chinese investments in Egypt under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and implementing the outcomes of the first China-Arab States Summit held in Saudi Arabia in December last year. Egypt looks forward to further strengthening cooperation with China and attracting more Chinese investments, especially in participating in the construction of key projects which will improve Egyptian people's livelihood, employment, and industrial localization, said Hossam Heiba, the CEO of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones of Egypt. In his keynote speech to the seminar, Ambassador Liao said that China will continue to firmly pursue mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up policies and promote high-level opening-up and high-quality development of the joint construction of the "Belt and Road," which provide new opportunities for countries including Egypt. Reviewing the achievements of the China-Egypt economic and trade cooperation in recent years, Liao emphasized that the core of such cooperation is mutual benefit and win-win results. He said that the joint BRI construction is highly compatible with Egypt's 2030 Vision, adding that China will strengthen coordination with Egypt on implementing the nine programs announced at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the eight major cooperation initiatives proposed at the China-Arab States Summit.
