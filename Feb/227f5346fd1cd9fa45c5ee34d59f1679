World Aquatics on Tuesday released the calendar of the Diving World Cup for 2023. There will be three events in the tournament this year, starting in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, between April 14 and 16. China has one of the top diving teams and has hosted seven previous Diving World Cups, 14 editions of the Diving World Series and 13 Diving Grand Prix events. Three of the Grand Prix competitions were in Xi'an between 2000 and 2002. After Xi'an, the Diving World Cup will travel to Montreal, Canada, between May 5 and 7. As the city that held three Diving World Series in a row between 2018 and 2020, Montreal will have the athletes compete in the well-known Montreal Olympic Pool that has been in use since the Olympic Games in 1976. This year's Diving World Cup will conclude in the Super Final Berlin, Germany, between August 4 and 6. The German capital hosted 20 consecutive editions of the Diving Grand Prix between 2001 and 2020. The World Cup also took place there for the first time last year. The competition format of the Diving World Cup has been revised for 2023. Instead of having to go through rounds of competitions – preliminary, semi-final, final – in the individual events, athletes will participate in the final right after the preliminary. As for the synchronized and team events, there will be only finals for divers to compete in. "I really felt the mojo with the diving working group and where we are setting up the sport for the next years heading into the World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka and the Paris 2024 Games," World Aquatics Athletes' Committee member Jack Laugher said. "The future of our sport is bright. I'm excited about the upcoming changes we'll see in diving. From the refinement of the competition format to having a deeper prize pool, we're making this sport even more attractive for athletes. This gives me, my peers, and future generations more to aim for and achieve in this beautiful sport," he added.
