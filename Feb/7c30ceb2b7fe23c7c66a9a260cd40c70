German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of enduring allied support, at talks hosted by France's Emmanuel Macron. Scholz said that Germany and its partners had backed Ukraine "financially, with humanitarian aid and with weapons" since February last year. "We will continue to do so as long as necessary," he told reporters. The assurance came after Zelenskyy urged France and Germany to deliver combat planes and heavy weaponry "as soon as possible" as he visited Paris after a trip to the UK where he met British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and signed a Declaration of Unity regarding allied cooperation and mutual support between the two countries. "The sooner Ukraine gets long-range heavy weaponry, the sooner our pilots get planes, the sooner this Russian aggression will end and we can return to peace in Europe," he said in Paris alongside the leaders of France and Germany.
