The Yellow River is considered the mother river of the Chinese nation. For thousands of years, it has been the cradle of Chinese civilization, with the people living along its banks having nurtured an enduring culture that is rich and vibrant. In order to protect the ecological environment of the Yellow River, support the sustainable development of the surrounding areas, and showcase its cultural heritage, a project to create a series of parks along the river's banks is now underway, involving nine provincial-level regions. Some museums are also planned to present the historical and cultural relics discovered here and promote the culture of the Yellow River, using AR, VR and other advanced technologies. What's more, a series of activities will be arranged to protect and inherit the culture of those ethnics living along the river, demonstrating the unique charm of traditional Chinese culture. The project incorporates archaeological research and the protection of cultural relics in these areas. This rich heritage serves as an important resource for the construction of the Yellow River National Cultural Park. The project will make full use of the existing archaeological sites, bringing these ancient relics back to life so they can tell their stories. Flood control and disaster prevention work will be carried out along the Yellow River to protect the environment and keep residents safe while these cultural parks are being built. They will be developed as a new kind of "intelligent parks" featuring advanced technologies and creative models to provide residents with some brand-new infrastructure.
