Washington has leveled "ludicrous allegations," claiming China's civilian unmanned airship violated "territorial integrity," Iranian daily newspaper Tehran Times has recently said in a commentary. The piece quoted Beijing's explanation saying that the balloon was meant to conduct "meteorological" research and had strayed into American airspace because of heavy winds. "Experts have echoed the account, saying the hard-to-maneuver and high-altitude weather test balloon was blown by winds across North America," according to the daily. It said the U.S.'s accusations are "actually quite laughable" as balloons were used for surveillance purposes some 70 to 80 years ago. (Cover: A view of a street in Tehran, Iran, April 8, 2022. /CFP)
