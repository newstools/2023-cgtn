Rangers at Qilian Mountain National Park ­­in northwest China's Gansu Province recently captured stunning footage of a flock of blue sheep foraging on cliffs. About 200 blue sheep were seen in the Shidalong Nature Reserve area of the park. Blue sheep, also called bharal or yanyang in Chinese, live mostly on alpine bare rocks, meadows and valleys and at altitudes of 2,000 to 3,000 meters. They have a coat that has a similar color to the surroundings, making predators hard to locate them. Blue sheep are under second-class state protection in China. In recent years, local authorities have stepped up efforts to improve the ecological environment, providing better habitats for wild animals and resulting in the growing size of the wild animal population.
