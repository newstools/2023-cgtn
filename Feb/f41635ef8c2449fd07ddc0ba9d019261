China's Shenzhou-15 astronauts will conduct extravehicular activities (EVAs) for the first time in the next few days, according to the China Manned Space Agency. The crew stayed at China Space Station for 70 days after the spacecraft was launched on November 30, 2022. During their stay, the taikonauts completed the rotation with the Shenzhou-14 crew in orbit, unlocked and tested the scientific experiment cabinets and unloaded the application payloads. In addition, the taikonauts also conducted equipment inspections and prepared for extravehicular activities (EVAs). The crew has also carried out in-orbit medical checks, an array of experiments for space science and exercises in a microgravity environment. In January, they spent the Spring Festival in space, sending their best new year wishes to the people on the ground. The Shenzhou-15 crew is in good condition and the space station operates stably, ready to carry out EVAs, the first one for the crew.
