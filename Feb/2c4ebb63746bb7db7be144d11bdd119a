Former World Bank chief said U.S. should not postpone Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to China but rather strengthen communication and contacts with China in an opinion piece published by the Washington Post. "The rising competition between the world's leading powers grows ever more dangerous. The job of diplomacy is to manage those dangers through open communication. Both China and the United States stretch for information because they seek to know about the capabilities and — if possible — intentions of the other," said Robert B. Zoellick, who was president of the World Bank from 2007 to 2012 after serving as deputy secretary of state and U.S. trade representative. He suggested that in order to avoid escalations from information-gathering to kinetic conflict, both countries should open channels to communicate rapidly, like modern hotlines, and propose a transparency agenda to share information. "Countries conduct diplomacy to pursue their interests, not to bestow favors on other nations," he concluded by stating Blinken should go to Beijing. Earlier this month, an unmanned Chinese civilian airship, affected by the Westerlies and due to its limited self-steering capability, deviated from its planned course and entered U.S. airspace. Despite China's calls for the issue to be handled in a rational and professional manner, the U.S. shot down the airship with a missile.
