World number one Iga Swiatek of Poland defeated American Jessica Pegula 6-3, 6-0 in just over an hour to defend her Qatar Open title on Saturday. Swiatek dropped only five games throughout the week to clinch her first title in the WTA Tour this year, also the 12th singles title in her career. The Pole hopes the victory will kick start a run similar to last year when she built on her impressive winning streak of 37 matches in Doha and later claimed two Grand Slam titles at the French Open and U.S. Open. "I feel like I found my rhythm here after a tough beginning to the season," said Swiatek after her shock exit in the fourth round of the Australian Open at the hands of Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina from Kazakhstan.
