The Chinese mainland has urged Taiwan authorities not to use COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to hinder the resumption of direct flights across the Taiwan Straits, a mainland spokesperson said on Wednesday. As the COVID-19 situation on the mainland has been stabilized, compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and the aviation industry are eagerly looking forward to the full resumption of direct cross-strait flights, said Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council at a press briefing. It is reported that the mainland's aviation authorities have recently contacted Taiwan authorities through existing channels, calling on the two sides to promote the normal operation of cross-strait air routes. It was suggested that priority should be given to the restoration of direct flights to 16 destinations, including south China's Guangzhou City, where there is a high concentration of Taiwan compatriots. Confirming the reports, Zhu stressed that the mainland is ready to resume direct flights across the Taiwan Straits with no restrictions or obstacles. She urged Taiwan authorities to align with the people's will, and make pragmatic efforts to help resume the normal operations of direct cross-strait flights.
