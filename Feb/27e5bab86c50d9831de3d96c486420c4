New York City police have arrested a U-Haul truck driver accused of deliberately plowing into pedestrians on Monday, injuring at least eight people before officers chased him down and stopped the vehicle, authorities said. The "violent rampage" through the Bay Ridge neighborhood of New York's Brooklyn borough left two victims hospitalized in critical condition and two in serious condition, City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell told reporters on Monday afternoon. Four others sustained minor injuries, she said, including a police officer.
