"As for the future cooperation between China and Cambodia, I think we can summarize it as "one position, six-way cooperation and two corridors," said Sun Weidong, China's vice foreign minister, during an interview with China Media Group, after Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia Hun Sen on February 10 at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing. He pointed out one position is the two countries agreed to work together to build a high-quality, high-level and high-standard China-Cambodia community with a shared future in the new era; while the other one is “six-way cooperation,” which is also called the “diamond hexagon” framework, covering six key areas including politics, industry, agriculture, energy, security and culture and people-to-people exchange.
