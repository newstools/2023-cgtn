Six U.S. Army oil storage facilities containing toxic substances in Okinawa Prefecture will be dismantled by 2026, local media the Okinawa Times reported on Monday. The substances the facilities contain include foam fire extinguishing agents containing organic fluorine compounds, which are harmful to humans, according to the Okinawa Times. The facilities are no longer in use and have corroded, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. In January 2016, the government of Okinawa Prefecture detected high concentrations of organic fluorides in a water source near the Kadena base of the U.S. military. However, the Japanese side has no right to enter the base for investigation and the U.S. side has always refused to publicly admit responsibility for this and declined to be investigated. According to the Okinawa Times, internal emails of the U.S. military believe that the base is likely to cause pollution.
