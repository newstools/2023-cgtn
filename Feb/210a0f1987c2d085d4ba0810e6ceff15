Wide receiver A.J. Green of the Arizona Cardinals, announced his retirement on Instagram on Monday. "I've never been a man of many words, so I'll keep this short. Thank you. Thank you to all who have supported, encouraged, and inspired me throughout my career. Special thank you to the University of Georgia, Cincinnati Bengals, and Arizona Cardinals for the opportunity to pursue my dreams. I've stayed true to the game and it owes me nothing. Be blessed.. Love y'all! The next chapter beginsâ€¦" Green wrote. In his 11th NFL season, Green started in 10 of his 15 appearances to complete 24 catches for 236 receiving yards and two touchdowns. During his prime time in the Cincinnati Bengals, which drafted him with the fourth pick in 2011, Green had over 1,000 receiving yards in six of the nine seasons there, including five in a row between 2011 and 2015. Green ranks second in the Bengals' history in catches (649), receiving yards (9,430) and touchdowns (65). He was named for the Pro-Bowl for seven straight times between 2011 and 2017 and a two-time Second-team All-Pro member. Though Green has been on his way down since 2020, he still managed to surpass 10,000 receiving yards, becoming the fifth one to do so since 2011. The other four are Julio Jones, Mike Evans, Antonio Brown and Andre Hopkins. Green's decision to retire is not a caprice of the moment as he tossed the idea in an interview with ESPN in December 2022. "Whatever happens is going to happen. I made the money. I have the accolades, I'm stress free. Whatever happens next year, I'm at peace with it. If I want to play, then I will have an opportunity, but if I don't want to play, I can walk around with my head held high," Green said. "I always told people ... physically, I can play this game for a while, but mentally I don't know if I can go through it again. You know what I mean? And I'm a guy that never wanted to cheat the game, so if I'm not all-in, I'm going to be all out," he added.
