Pep Guardiola, manager of Premier League team Manchester City, said on Saturday that no one can take away the titles he and his club have won when asked about the recent investigation into Man City's financial affairs. One of the most dominant clubs in the English top league for over a decade, Man City have been charged with more than 100 breaches of the leagueâ€™s financial regulations between 2009 and 2018. As a result, they may face punishments including points deductions, expulsion from the Premier League and being stripped of the championships they have won. "At the end, always we leave thinking what other people think about us. Forget about it. Think what we have done. No one can remove it," Guardiola said. "The bad moments we leave, but it is not going to change. It was built from day one. We won a lot. We want to defend that position, until it is not possible." "The Premier League will decide but I know what we won, and the way we won it, with the effort we put in. For something that happened in 2009 or 2010, I don't how long ago it was, it is not going to change one second. They belong to us. Absolutely, they belong to us. Regardless of the sentence, they belong to us," he added. Man City have won six Premier League titles and two FA Cup championships since 2011, over half of them were claimed under Guardiola. The club have been one of the biggest spenders on the European football transfer market since Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan acquired them in 2008, but they have been paying more attention to youth development in recent years. Man City are currently second on the Premier League's standings table and six points behind Arsenal. Compared with the domestic league championship that they have won four times in the past five seasons, Man City are more eager for the UEFA Champions League title. They have advanced to the Round of 16 of the tournament and will play Red Bull Leipzig in the first-leg game at the Red Bull Arena in Leipzig, Germany on February 22.
