Lantern Festival, or Yuan Xiao Festival, is a traditional Chinese festival that falls on the 15th day of the first lunar month, marking the end of the Spring Festival celebrations. On this day, Marissa, a vlogger from the United States who now lives in Hubei Province's Wuhan City, took to the streets to experience the bustling vibe, watching dragon and lion dances, eating sweet dumplings and enjoying festive lanterns.
