China's first integrated production and refueling station for hydrogen produced from methanol is in operation in the Dalian Free Trade Zone, northeast China's Liaoning Province. The station has the capacity to produce 1,000 kilograms of 99.99 percent pure hydrogen every day. Project partner Sinopec said that there is no solid waste, wastewater discharge, or tail gas pollution in the manufacturing process. China has pledged to achieve carbon peaking by 2030 and neutrality by 2060.
