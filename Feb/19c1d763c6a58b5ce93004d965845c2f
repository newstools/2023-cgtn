U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday arrived at Türkiye's Incirlik Air Base and was greeted by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. He and Cavusoglu conducted aerial surveys in the earthquake zone with a helicopter belonging to the Turkish Armed Forces, Anadolu Agency reported. Also topping the agenda will be the stalled NATO bids of Sweden and Finland, which Türkiye has so far refused to ratify. Ankara has recently indicated it would approve only Finland.
