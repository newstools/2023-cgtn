After entering Malatya, TÃ¼rkiye on February 9, the first squad from China's Blue Sky Rescue team was quickly divided into seven groups and rushed to different work sites. "We all came to the scene at our own expense. We have more than 150 team members here," says Zheng Furui, captain of Sichuan Blue Sky Rescue team. "The biggest difficulty here is that we don't know the exact information about the people who are buried... We will try to do our best to fulfill our rescue mission." A second group of the team members is expected to depart China on February 11.
