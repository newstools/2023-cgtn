Russia's Progress MS-21 cargo spacecraft undocked from the Russian segment of the International Space Station (ISS) early on Saturday, and will later splash down in the Pacific Ocean, TASS news agency reported. The astronauts used a teleoperation system to turn the spaceship and took pictures of the damaged areas. "Everything was done well, even more than planned," TASS reported citing a mission control specialist during a live broadcast. A pressure glitch was reported last week in the cooling system of the Progress MS-21 cargo spaceship. The causes are under investigation. The pressure loss led to the delay of a Soyuz MS-23 ship which was originally set to be launched on February 20 to take back three in-orbit astronauts. The Progress MS-21 spaceship was launched on October 26, 2022 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. It docked with the ISS two days later, delivering 2.5 tonnes of cargo, including various equipment, fuel, compressed nitrogen, water and food. Russia's Soyuz spaceship are used to shuttle astronauts between Earth and the ISS, while the Progress MS vessels are to deliver supplies and conduct orbit corrections for the ISS. The Progress MS vehicles are not recyclable. After resupply missions, the vessel will carry in-orbit wastes and burn in the atmosphere after deorbiting. The remaining parts splash down in non-navigational areas of the Pacific Ocean.
