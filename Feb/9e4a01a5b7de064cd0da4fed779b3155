The ruling party in Djibouti has retained its significant majority in parliament, a presidential advisor told AFP on Tuesday. Provisional results had given 58 seats to the Union for Presidential Majority (UMP) party, said Alexis Mohamed, a special advisor to President Ismail Omar Guelleh, who has ruled the country since 1999. The remaining seven seats went to the only other party in the race, the Union for Democracy and Justice (UDJ).
