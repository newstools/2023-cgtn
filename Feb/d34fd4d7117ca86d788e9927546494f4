In the past three years, the COVID virus has been constantly mutating, and China has responded with prompt action to adjust its prevention and control policies. From optimizing the measures adopted in Wuhan, to issuing a series of ten protocols and treatment plans, the adjustment of the COVID strategy has consistently adhered to the principle of prioritizing people's life and health. Zhong Nanshan, a top Chinese expert on respiratory diseases, estimated that from early 2020 to December 2022, the COVID-19 death rate on the Chinese mainland was less than one-two-hundredths of the global average, and almost one-nine-hundredths that of the U.S. In effect, nearly 20 million lives were saved.
