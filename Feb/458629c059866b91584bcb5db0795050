Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has said the supply of more advanced U.S. weaponry to Ukraine will only trigger more retaliatory strikes from Russia, up to the extent of Russia's nuclear doctrine. "All of Ukraine that remains under Kyiv's rule will burn," journalist Nadana Fridrikhson quoted him as saying in a written interview with her. Asked what would happen if the weapons that Washington has promised Ukraine were to strike Crimea or deep into Russia, Medvedev said, "We don't set ourselves any limits and, depending on the nature of the threats, we're ready to use all types of weapons. In accordance with our doctrinal documents, including the Fundamentals of Nuclear Deterrence." "I can assure you that the answer will be quick, tough and convincing," he added. On Friday, the Pentagon said that a new rocket that would double Ukraine's strike range was included in a $2.175 billion U.S. military aid package. Meanwhile, Portugal will send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and is working with Germany to get the parts needed to repair the tanks that are not operational, Portugal Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Saturday. Costa hoped that the tanks can be delivered to Ukraine by the end of March. According to Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, the country would receive 120 to 140 Western tanks in a "first wave" of deliveries from a coalition of 12 countries. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed on Friday that Ukrainians will fight "for as long as we can" to hold the eastern city of Bakhmut, as he hosted European Union (EU) leaders to discuss further sanctions on Russia and Kyiv's prospects for joining the EU. Moscow says Russian forces are encircling the city and battling to take control of a road which is also an important supply route for Ukrainian forces.
