World-renowned Chinese veteran artist Chen Jialing opened a painting and calligraphy exhibition themed on plum blossoms at Rongbaozhai in Beijing on Saturday. The exhibition displays over 50 sets of paintings and calligraphy works accompanied by poems in praise of the plum blossom. Chen said in the opening ceremony that the spirit of the plum blossom lies in being fearless of severe cold as well as resilience. The 85-year-old added that he would like to showcase his spiritual outlook as an old artist during the epidemic through his works in the exhibition, in an effort to embody the quality of human life. Well-known in Chinese art circles for his desire to change and adapt, Chen has conducted in-depth research on the traditional history of Chinese painting. His artistic style not only integrates the traditional Chinese artistic spirit, but also highlights innovative consciousness of the Shanghai school artists.
