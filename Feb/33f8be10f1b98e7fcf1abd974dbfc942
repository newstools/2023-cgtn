An aviation brigade of the Chinese Air Force organized flight training to improve its ability to be ready for operations at all times. In one of the simulated situations, a foreign aircraft was approaching China's air defense identification zone. A fighter on the Chinese side quickly set off, followed, monitored and identified the aircraft while warning with signals and movements. After repeated warnings ended to no avail, the Chinese side quickly simulated an infrared missile warning and successfully drove away the "foreign aircraft".
