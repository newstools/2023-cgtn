China is launching a pilot program to promote the green transition in the public sector, according to an official document released Saturday. The public sector vehicles include public service vehicles, city buses, taxies, sanitation vehicles, delivery vehicles, logistics vehicles and vehicles at airports, according to the document jointly released by eight government departments, including China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Transport and the National Development and Reform Commission. The pilot period is from 2023 to 2025, and cities can volunteer to participate in the pilot program, according to the document. A major goal is to increase the proportion of electric vehicles (EVs) in city buses, cabs, sanitary vehicles, delivery vehicles and logistics vehicles to 80 percent by 2025 in pilot cities, the document said. The country will plan in advance and build an intelligent and efficient charging and battery swap infrastructure system to meet the increasing demand, and the document set the target of adding the same amount of public charging piles as the number of EVs newly added to the public sector.
