MSU's police later confirmed in a press conference that three people were killed in the shooting, in addition to five victims who have been transported to the hospital, some of whom had life-threatening injuries. In an updated tweet, the police said the suspect has been located off campus, where he was found dead from "a self-inflicted gunshot wound." The police added that there is no longer a threat to campus and the shelter-in-place has been lifted.
