The Denver Nuggets beat the Los Angeles Clippers 134-124 in overtime (OT) at Ball Arena in Denver, Colorado, on Sunday, keeping a perfect 23-0 record during which Nikola Jokic scored a double-double. Having shot 14-for-21 from the field to drop 40 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists, Jokic sealed the deal for the Nuggets with a defensive move. They led 132-124 at 1:34 in OT. Jamal Murray missed a 3-pointer, but when the Clippers drove forward, Marcus Morris' pass to Kawhi Leonard was cut by Jokic in the logo. Jokic then charged to the paint and then tossed the ball to the air for Bruce Brown to finish an alley-oop, extending their lead to 10 points. That was Jokic's 10th assist on Sunday night and brought him the 23rd triple-double this season. When he was on the court and received the ball, the Clippers were unlikely to stop him no matter what defensive tactics they used on him. Mason Plumlee could match Jokic in size and is much more athletic, but Jokic can force his way on him by exploiting his power advantage. Other Clippers worked very hard to deny him the ball, but there wasn't much they could do when Jokic performed his skillful footwork. Aaron Gordon came back for the Nuggets after missing five games, but he apparently still needed time to find his regular form back. Having got six points, six rebounds and six assists, he missed all five of his triples and was fouled out in the fourth quarter. Fortunately for the team, Michael Porter Jr. and Murray stood out to ease the offensive load on Jokic. Porter Jr. went 12-for-18 to score 29 points and 11 rebounds; Murray had a double-double of 21 points and 12 assists. Despite the loss, the Clippers showed remarkable resilience in Sunday's game. They trailed 27-9 early in the first quarter and didn't lead until the final five minutes in the fourth period. They obviously couldn't stop Jokic from dominating the floor, but coach Tyronn Lue targeted Jokic's slow movement on defense by sending a small-ball squad to the game for both speed and spacing. Shooting 11-for-34 from downtown was not what the Clippers expected from a five-out lineup, but their defensive aggressiveness caused a lot of trouble for the Nuggets. With 11 steals, they forced 14 turnovers by the Nuggets and turned them into 20 fast break points. Russell Westbrook, who continued to start for the Clippers on Sunday night, contributed five steals in addition to 17 points and five assists. He was benched in the fourth quarter and OT as the team wanted to space the floor. Leonard could have been the Clippers' hero if he had extended his incredible performance to OT. Having made 12 of his 18 field goal (FG) attempts in the first four quarters to drop 33 points, Leonard only took one shot in OT and missed it. Paul George went 11-for-11 at the free throw line, but he missed all four shots behind the arc. Other games on Sunday (away teams come first): Los Angeles Lakers 111-108 Dallas Mavericks The Lakers beat a 27-point deficit (48-21) to secure their biggest comeback win since 2002 at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, on Sunday.

Jarred Vanderbilt had a double-double of 15 points, 17 rebounds, including eight on the offensive glass, and four steals. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combined to miss 26 of their 44 FGs to get 47 points for the Mavericks. The two also committed nine turnovers in total. Irving has made six appearances for the team since he was traded here and they lost three of them. Doncic played in four of those six games and the Mavericks lost three of them. Minnesota Timberwolves 104-109 Golden State Warriors The two teams both had two well-performing quarters at the Chase Center in San Francisco, California, on Sunday. The Timberwolves outscored the Warriors 34-25 and 30-19 in the first and third periods respectively; the Warriors replied 34-23 and 31-17 in the second and fourth quarters. Klay Thompson drained six triples to score game-high 32 points for the Warriors. Donte DiVincenzo contributed universal numbers of 21 points, eight rebounds, five assists and four steals. He had 10 points for the team in the four quarter in which they launched the game-winning rally. Houston Rockets 114-131 Portland Trail Blazers You know something big was happening after Damian Lillard made eight shots from downtown in the first half to get 41 points at the Moda Center in Portland, Oregon, on Sunday. Having remained unstoppable in the second half, Lillard added another 30 points to his stats sheet to complete an epic night. Lillard, 32, set a new career high in scoring and became the third active player in today's NBA to score 70 or more points. Unlike Devin Booker who did it for the Phoenix Suns in 2017, Lillard's team won; unlike Donovan Mitchell who did for the Cleveland Cavaliers in January, Lillard did it in regular time. Moreover, Lillard is the oldest player to score 70 or more points in NBA history and the only to do so after the age of 30.
