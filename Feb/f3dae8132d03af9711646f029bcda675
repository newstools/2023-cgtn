Six projects were listed as the "2022 New Archaeological Discoveries in China" at an archaeology forum on Wednesday in Beijing. The forum was held by the Institute of Archaeology under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Shiyan Xuetangliangzi Paleolithic Site in central China's Hubei Province and Shangyi Sitai Neolithic Ruins in north China's Hebei Province both made the list, as did the Qingyang Nanzuo Neolithic Site in northwest China's Gansu Province. The Royal Tomb area and surrounding relics in the Yin Ruins dating back to the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 B.C.) in Anyang, central China's Henan Province, were also billed among the best new finds of last year, as was the Kunming Hebosuo Bronze Age Site in southwest China's Yunnan Province, and the Helan Suyukou Porcelain Kiln Site in Yinchuan, northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The event invited the leaders responsible for the selected projects to introduce the status of their archaeological excavations. The discoveries span from the Paleolithic Age to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). Aiming to promote academic exchanges and contribute to the growth of Chinese archaeology in the modern era, the Archaeology Forum of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences was established in 2002 to provide a platform for experts to discuss the latest archaeological discoveries, share information, and discuss new developments in the field. "New Archaeological Discoveries in China" selects six projects each year and has become one of the most important awards in the field of archaeology. By regularly announcing new archaeological discoveries, the story of mankind's origins spanning millions of years is gradually being pieced together, along with prehistoric civilizations spanning tens of thousands of years.
