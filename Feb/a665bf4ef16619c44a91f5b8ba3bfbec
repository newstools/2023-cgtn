NATO's so-called New Strategic Concept Paper has misrepresented facts, wrongly defined China as posing "systemic challenges," smeared China's foreign policy and smacked heavily of Cold War mentality and ideological bias, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular press briefing on Thursday. China is gravely concerned by this and firmly opposes it, he said. On Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said after the NATO defense ministers meeting that the ministers had reached a consensus on new political guidelines for NATO defense planning, which addresses the challenge from China. Noting that China is known to be a force for world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of the international order, Wang said China does not pose "systemic challenges," as wrongly purported by NATO. Claiming itself as a regional defensive alliance, NATO has constantly sought to make advances into new areas and domains, created tension and encouraged confrontation, Wang said. China urges NATO to abandon the outdated Cold War mentality, halt the dangerous attempt to destabilize Europe and the Asia-Pacific, and act in the interest of security and stability in Europe and beyond, the spokesperson said.
