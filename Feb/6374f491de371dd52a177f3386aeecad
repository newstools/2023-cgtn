China has fulfilled its international responsibility and provided over 2.2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations, according to the National Health Commission. More than 100 countries have approved the use of Chinese vaccines, and leaders from over 30 countries have taken the lead in taking Chinese vaccines. Three of the Chinese vaccine products are on the Emergency Use Listing of the World Health Organization (WHO).
