United Nations General Assembly President Csaba Kőrösi visited China from February 1 to 4 at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. As a UN founding member and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has always been a strong backer of the UN, and it has greatly contributed to efforts on climate change and peacekeeping. How can China better deal with global challenges through the UN Charter mission? What can be expected from the UNGA president’s visit? On these and more, CGTN’s Tian Wei had an exclusive interview with the UN General Assembly President Kőrösi. He said that he came China to find partners, but instead found allies.
