The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has conducted two searches at the University of Delaware in connection with President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents, CNN reported on Wednesday, citing a source familiar with the investigation. Investigators have retrieved materials which did not appear to have classified markings, but they are now being reviewed by the FBI. The library of the university, Biden's alma mater, houses a large collection of papers from the president's time in the Senate, its website shows.
