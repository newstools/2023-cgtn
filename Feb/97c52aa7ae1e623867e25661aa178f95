Ice and snow tourism continues to be a popular draw for visitors to northeast China's Jilin Province, despite the approach of spring. In a season to enjoy the winter chill, ice and snow tourism projects are resonating among many of the tourists in the wake of the Beijing Winter Olympics. Cultural and sporting elements combine with nature to attract visitors from all over the country. Known as China's "cradle of skiing," Tonghua in Jilin Province has seen more than 5.7 million trips made by visitors since January, generating a tourism revenue of around 3.3 billion yuan (about $486 million U.S. dollars), an increase of more than 400 percent in terms of visitor numbers and profit compared to a year ago. Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve in Jilin has made full use of its natural resources and launched a variety of winter activities such as snowmobile trips and horse-drawn sleigh rides. In order to enhance access to scenic spots, Tonghua tourism authorities distributed 8,000 coupons and entrance tickets for free. It also arranged 150 shuttle buses to take visitors to Changbai Mountain's must-see destination â€“ Tianchi Lake, or Heavenly Lake. In recent years, Jilin Province has been making efforts to develop its ice and snow tourism industry. The "ice and snow economy" is fast becoming a new engine for rural revitalization, broadening and diversifying sources of income for local people during the snow season.
