The 2025 World Aquatics Championships will be held in Singapore, World Aquatics announced on Thursday. Kazan, a city in Russia, had won the bid to host the 2025 World Championships, but owing to international sanctions against Russia, Singapore will instead host the premier international aquatics event. "World Aquatics could not be happier to know that the hosting of our main event for 2025 is in such good hands, thanks to the team here in Singapore," said World Aquatics President Husain Al-Musallam. With dates to be defined, over 2,500 athletes are expected to participate in the showcase event in 2025, representing World Aquatics' 209 member federations. Japan's Fukuoka will host the 20th World Aquatics Championships this July, as the tournament was originally scheduled to be staged in 2021. It was postponed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated travel restrictions. The 21st World Championships, originally scheduled for summer 2023, was rescheduled to take place in Doha in February 2024.
