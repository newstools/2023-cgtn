They will miss the tournament for the first time in 41 years. The draw for this year's World Cup will take place in the Pilipino capital city of Manila on April 29. The two host teams, the Philippines and Japan will both play at home â€“ the third host Indonesia failed to qualify for the tournament. All three hosts have selected preferred teams to play in their respective countries during the group stage for commercial reasons. USA will play in the Philippines; Slovenia will go to Japan; Canada will compete in Indonesia. China must perform well in the World Cup to secure early qualification for the Olympic Games in Paris in 2024. The tournament this year will generate seven of the 12 qualified teams for Paris 2024. Two of these berths will go to the best-performing teams of Asia and Oceania. That means China must achieve a better record than the Philippines, Japan, Lebanon, Jordan and Iran. China appointed a new head coach, Aleksandar Djordjevic, in November 2022. The team beat Kazakhstan and Iran in their final two World Cup Asian qualifier games in south China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region last week.
