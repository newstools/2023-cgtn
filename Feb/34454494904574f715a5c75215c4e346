A train with about 31 cars carrying coal derailed in Gothenburg, Nebraska, early Tuesday, the Union Pacific Railroad said in a statement to CBS News. No one was injured, cleanup has begun, and the three tracks near the derailment, which occurred around 1:45 a.m., were reopened at around 8 a.m. While early reports stated hazardous materials were spilled, Union Pacific said "no hazmat was involved." The cause of the incident is being investigated.
