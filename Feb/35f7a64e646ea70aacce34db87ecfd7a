The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy guided-missile destroyer Nanning has left Zayed Port in Abu Dhabi to resume its 43rd naval escort mission in the Gulf of Aden, after participating in the Naval Defense and Maritime Security Exhibition. More than 1,300 companies from over 70 countries participated in the five-day exhibition. China sent a delegation to the exhibition to demonstrate its advanced science and technology capabilities in the defense industry. Over 2,000 visitors, including overseas Chinese, visited Nanning during a two-day open ship event. Many UAE visitors gushed that China's dispatch of the advanced guided-missile destroyer to the exhibition was the best demonstration of the friendship between the two countries.
