Nicola Sturgeon said on Wednesday she's resigning as Scotland's first minister after eight years in the job. "Today I am announcing my intention to step down as first minister and leader of my party," Sturgeon told a press conference at Bute House in Edinburgh. "I will remain in office until my successor is elected." "In my head and in my heart I know that time is now. It is right for me, my party and the country," she continued, noting that the decision was not linked to recent short-term issues. "My decision comes from a place of duty and love."
