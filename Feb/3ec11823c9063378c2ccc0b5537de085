At least 17 people were killed and 12 others injured in a head-on collision between a truck and a mini-bus in Tanzania's northern district of Korogwe in the Tanga region, an official said on Saturday. The Tanga regional commissioner, Omary Mgumba, said in a statement that the mini-bus was carrying 26 mourners and a body from Dar es Salaam to Moshi in the Kilimanjaro region for burial when the accident occurred on Friday night. The truck collided head-on with the mini-bus after its driver failed to take precautions as he overtook another vehicle, Mgumba said.
