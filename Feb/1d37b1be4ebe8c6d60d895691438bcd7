Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday sent a message of condolences to Pakistani President Arif Alvi over a deadly terrorist attack in Pakistan's Peshawar, which saw a suicide bombing kill over 100 people. President Xi extended condolences to the bereaved families of the deceased and expressed sincere sympathy for the injured on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. In the message, the Chinese president condemned the attack, adding that China resolutely opposes all forms of terrorism and is willing to deepen counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan to jointly maintain peace and security in the region and globe. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also sent a message of condolences to Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif the same day over the attack. The blast occurred at about 1:13 p.m. local time on Monday in the Police Lines area when a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest in the front row of the prayer congregation inside a mosque in Peshawar. The banned Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan has claimed responsibility, saying that a 25-year-old member targeted the police to avenge the death of a militant commander. (With input from Xinhua)
