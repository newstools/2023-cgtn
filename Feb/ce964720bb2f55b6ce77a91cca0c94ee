The European Commission is asking its employees to remove the Chinese short video-sharing app TikTok from their corporate phones, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said on Thursday. Responding to the move, TikTok said the decision by the European Commission was based on mistaken ideas about its platform. "We are disappointed with this decision, which we believe to be misguided and based on fundamental misconceptions," a spokesperson for the Chinese-owned company said. China's Foreign Ministry has responded, in previous cases, that foreign countries' banning of TikTok is equivalent of using political weapons to suppress Chinese companies and could be a breach of World Trade Organization rules.
