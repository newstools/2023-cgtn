Bilateral trade between China and the U.S. hit a record high in 2022, according to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce on Thursday, citing data from both countries. The ministry's spokesperson Shu Jueting said this fully demonstrates that the economic structure between the two countries was "highly complementary." It also shows the mutually beneficial and win-win nature of economic and trade cooperation, she said. Shu also said that China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation concerns the vital interests of both countries and plays a crucial role in global economic growth. China has always adhered to open cooperation and provided opportunities for the world through its development, she said. Meanwhile, the American Chamber of Commerce in China has noted that the Chinese market is not an "option" but a "must" for American enterprises, and it will work with its members to seize new development opportunities. The U.S.-China Business Council thinks that the "linkage" between the U.S. and China will benefit the two peoples, Shu noted. (Cover via CFP)
