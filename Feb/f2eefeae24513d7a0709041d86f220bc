Manchester United's 2-1 win over Barcelona in the second-leg of the UEFA Europa League Round of 32 competitions became one of the most important victories for the "Red Devils" this season. Erik ten Hag, who was appointed as Man United's manager after the 2021-22 campaign, has carved his team into an energetic and competitive group after the right players were brought in and underperformers were sent away. By contrast, Xavi, in his second season as Barca's manager, watched his team struggle even more in the European competitions. Unlike Man United, they don't have enough funding to reshuffle their lineup dramatically. Both clubs have gone through a lot of difficulties in recent years. Judging by their performances this season, Man United seem to be getting back on their feet faster.
